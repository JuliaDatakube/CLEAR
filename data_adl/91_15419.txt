sleeping murmur



dark bosom of mine -

god has taken his seat

in my dark bosom -

o world, let god live -

o world -



the voice, against which

I always have to listen,

the voice is telling me, incessantly

that a world of burning secrets

is to find

there

there in the deep, where

god has pleased to crouch

in the soft silence

of life -






people of the world,

I want to death, that

you should long towards

the dark spreading deep,

towards the dark unknown soil

in the bosom of mine -

people of the world,

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark unknown bosom of mine -



god is nourishing on

my joy and my sorrow -

people of the world,

I beseech you, give

to me an eternal life -!

people of the world,

let god live -!

people of the world,

forget yourself, and give

your children to drink the milk of the sun,

the innumerable secrets

of the fire, and god's heart

of lust -



people of the world -!

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark bosom of mine -

forget yourself and

give to your children

thefulfilling,

eternally waiting deep, where

god crouches in

waiting silence of life -
