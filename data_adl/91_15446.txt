hunting-song




I am no human -

the pace of my blood

is alien to all that is human -







I despise the ready-made limits and

the mercy from fear,

I hate themoulderingseparatenes

and thegeldedmass-will

of the human -



I am no human -

I adore my forcing desire

to destroy the want to build monuments

to strangle the insane need to rule

the detestable lust ofsubmission,

to stab the hateful want

to glorify all dying -



I am no human -

I am blind to

the greatness of mankind

except the black nerve

deep through the flesh of all living -

I have no faith

in the future of mankind

except in

the burning rhythm

quiveringmerciless

through the will of all living -



I am no human -

my cat-soft soul

is always on guard to shun

the track of all human -

the scent of my blood

is hostile to all that is human -

but -, alas -, I love

the dance in every foot of life,

o, I love

the song in the eyes of every fire,

and -, alas -, I can't but

bow in the dust







to each hand of creation

and everywombof love -




I am no human -

the raving dread

of all that is human

had driven me

step by step

deep into the forests of hatred -

but now I have triumphed -,

my voice has forgotten all words -,

my love

has made the forests my home -

I have found the fire

of my own rock -,

I have acknowledged

my seed of future -

at last -
