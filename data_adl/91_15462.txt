to the earth



now, mother -,

I have covered my face into yourbosom-

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -

now, mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -



mother -,

you gave me the power of giving the comfort

which alone isnourishingand bright -

but, mother -,

I would only once give, what you have given me,

and not being forced to take back my gifts ashitherto

for the sake of your purity -, my mother -



but now,

mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -
