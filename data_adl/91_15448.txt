the message of the chief



when you open

towards night or day

the shield-like tent-door

of your fate, calling:

I am this, I am that,

my need is all or nothing

or -:

mypride is not dependant

on neither joy nor shelter -!

when calling

towards night or day,

don't think you are god,

don't expect

your voice to fill






the gaping cup of your life -!

you are calling -,

that's all -

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the protective door

of your life-tent -

don't whisper,

in claiming rage:

I am this, I am that,

myneed is the need of a king

or that of a slave -!

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the saving door

of your life-tent -

do keep holy

the untranslatable sign of your blood

on the brow of yours -

do preserve

as your only treasure

the waiting silence

of your upright will -



don't send

your claiming calls

towards night nor day -

the answer

will come -
