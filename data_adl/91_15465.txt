to the body of my music



you speechless, useless

thing,

which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

what are you

really -?

are you just a trumpet,

you thing of my love -?

are you just atalon,

you beloved thing of my anger -?

or just an unused knife,

you beloved thing of my pride -?

what are you,

are you anything

real at all -?

come on,

you speechless, useless thing,

come on,

you which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

let us blow in your stupid trumpet,

let us tear with those insane talons,

let us use, then, this unused knife -,

come on, you -,

help me






to destroy

this human heart ofbarrenness

loiteringthrough all time

in this wonderful piece

of nature -,

come on now,

you -,

whatever you may be then

really -!
