and now we'll say



and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and now we'll say it:

we want

a new music into this world -



still we are no niggers -,

because we laugh in angry pain

over this insane civilization -

and still we are no infants

any longer -,

only because we are still able to laugh our corroding anger

over this hateful civilization -

and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and we'll say this too:

we can't be soothed any more

with caresses from this world

and we shall not -,

until we have

got a new music

into this world -






and don't believe

that we might just be let to die

in peaceful starvation,

before having crushed forth

the new music of ours

into this world -!
