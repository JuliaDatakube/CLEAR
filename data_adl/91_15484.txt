finished



no more havanas

no more dancing

and

no more happiness - no

happiness -

no more gold -

no gold, but

merciless

value - new

value -



no more madness -

no more barrenness -

and no more mercy -

- bread, children and






a new value to get light from

with no margin -

and no mercy -

a new scale

without mercy and

without escape -

not one -!

not THAT

any more

not once

more -

again -



now -

at last -

no more substitutes -

and no patience -

and no patience -

at last -

and no substitutes -

and

no

patience

any more -

it has grown

too late -

and there is

no holiday

left -



what is left for

you, you and you -

and you

is

thelast

the ultimate last

left opportunity

foreverything-






the new price,

or nothing -

the new

life or sterile death -

this minute and not tomorrow -

and no mercy -

and no kissing -

and

no escape -!
