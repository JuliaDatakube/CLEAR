a tale about love



there is the rock -

and the steel-bright, averted face -

but there is






the little door too -

and there is

my blood-red heart

burning on its golden foot -



but you

knock at the stone,

and you

promise to wait one hundred years

for the eyes to turn -

and you

cry your life to rags

because my heart

is a flame on its golden foot -



there was the rock -

and the closed, blind face -

but there was

the little door too -

and you

are nothing to me -
