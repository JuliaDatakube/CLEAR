the mother's death




my mother parted

the string of the universe from me,

bearing me a closed person,

but she left the string

of intention, her person's pride -



with the string

of herwombround my neck







I went,

would create the growth of the star

with my young man's fingers -

round my neck the intention

of person -



I ran to my woman,

I pulled at the string unknowingly

with my young blood -

I ran to my woman,

the string of the unfreed flesh

round my blood -



I would give the star

with my soul,

and I wanted my body

to be given me -

my poverty

the poverty of the unborn -



I parted my blood

from my flesh and I ran

to my woman -

I gave with my soul,

and I stole with my flesh,

and my blood was behind

silent -



I tore the soul of my woman,

I gave her my soul away

and failed -

and wept, the string

round my neck, proud

as ice -




I have killed my mother -

I hear the stream -, the ice

is thrown over -







I am black as blood,

I am silent as

sun and moon together,

my voice swept away with the broken ice -



I hear the stream of creation,

not mine, not yours, not hers -

I have killed my mother -

my soul stands upright in the flood

like anotterodder -

the star is soft as silver

down in the flood -



my face is finished,

and the tree of sleep

is waiting -

the stream is silent -

my tongue stands vibrating

in the dead heart

of the angry intentions of

all persons -



the stream of creation

is climbing onunheedingpaws

towards me -

my face is closed round itself

like the jaws of life -
