the foreboding



the glowing stone of nobility

is the eye -

through the jet-bright gate

of the eye goes

the irresistible stream

of the male-ruler's straight command -,

piercing merciless

the shells of poisoned resistance -

through the soft-opening mouth

of the eye does

the forcing-creative stream of submission

penetrate unheeding -

the new nobility,

which is to save the world's

heart and womb

to man,

is older than the died-away

nobility that failed -

the new nobility

must have

both the black blood-silent origin and

the tenderly redeeming future

in its eye -,

the glowing stone of all nobility -
