the ring



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -






I dig the claws of my soul

deep into the rock -

downwards, downwards -



the rock of darkness

has devoured me -

all directions

but one are torn asunder -

downwards, downwards -!



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -

softly, softly

I sink through the mountains

of blindness -



soon

I shall eat the scent

of the hearts of my brothers -

soon my drop

can't be distinguished

from those of my brothers -

soon the river

will close the ring of future -
