now I know you



now

I know you -

you have betrayed me -

your arms were warm






but your heart was white

and poor as steel -



now

I know you -

you have used me -

you wanted to sell

my will -

but do know -:

your prey shall be

the snake of my

righteous anger -,

when your feet will turn

down the path towards the market

of my enemies,

you'll have but the poverty

of yourself to sell -



do know -:

your own people you can't deceive -,

they

know your want,theyfeel

your naked soul in their hands -



now

I know you -

when smiling

into my enemies' faces,

your prey

shall be the unstained dagger

of the upright purity which you

could not love,

when you feel

the coins of your price

in the hands of your cunning,

in that moment, betrayer,

you'll have upon

your adorable neck the rising power,






you couldn't conquer -

you'll know,

that offering lips can be wounded,

the law

of the blood has never

been broken -



I know you -

be safe -,

youhave nothing to lose -

you

have betrayed,

but the will

you could rob of nothing -
