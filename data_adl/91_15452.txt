the gull



- this rock

is my place -

my eyes

are setting off on low wings

from this rock -

- this sea

is my life -

my eyes

are hovering on motionless wings

over this sea -






- my eyes

can grip only the far-off -

my eyes know no short distances -

- my eyes

have no colour to change -

my eyes are indifference to everything -

my eyes remember nothing but their unseen aim -

- my eyes

don't wait for anybody to rise -

my eyes know their place and their life -:

this rock -

this sea -

- everything else is dead unto my eyes -
