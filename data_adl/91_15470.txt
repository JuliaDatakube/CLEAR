warning



why do you return

to me -?

now there are no fetters left

for you to seek

and grasp and rule me by -

why do you return -?

all returning is wrong -

now I am a thousand times

more dangerous -

now all the dikes

are broken -

and the ways of my flood

are unknown even to my own

notcaring eye -

and now

all generosity of my heart

has gone,

and my old fountain

of tenderness is dry -

so why do you return -?

there is nothing left

in me of that,

which you care for -

there is only

a dark, stained will

of destruction left,

which I cannot guide

and am not willed to

any more -

so what do you return

for now -?

even my sight of you

is dim by now -

but come,

come -

what do I care -
