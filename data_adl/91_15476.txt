the song of my tribe



the men of my tribe

are mostly silent

and most of days

they go wandering

towards some unknown calling -



the men of my tribe

are mostly serious

and most of days

they go thinking

how far off the rest of their hearts do linger -



the men of my tribe

are mostly hungry

but on certain days

they sate their bodies

and souls in short joy -






the men of my tribe

are on the way towards the deserts

and the staring caves where life has hiddert,

to make their fires there -

the men of my tribe are mostly silent -
