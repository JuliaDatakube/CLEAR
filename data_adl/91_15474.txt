nights



there are nights when I know much -

when no stars venture to ascend

the black walls of pride -






when all the great cans are broken

without a sound -

when no timid heart can catch the tune

from the gates of orgy -

nights with no prices,

nights void of fear -



there are nights when I know much -

when the unseen rivers are felt

creeping blackly beneath my feet,

carrying silently the directions of the world's caravans -

nights when no man,

and no cry does mean much -

there are nights when the rivers show new ways of life,

only for the proud to use -

nights

for bursting wombs

to blossom,

for dying hearts

to kill -,

silent nights -,

nights for great tribes

to change their path for ever -,

for weapons never heard-of

to be seized by sleeping fingers -,

nights without speech -



nights when strings, rarely touched,

will disturb fate's sleep -,

nights from which

some men shall awake with new eyes

and few words left in their heart -
