 Preface For various reasons, this first critical edition of Reuelacionum sancte Birgitte liber I cum Prologo magistri Mathie has been a long time in the making. The fact that the edition can now be published, 600 years after the first handwritten Alfonso edition of Birgitta's revelations,' is to no small extent due to the energetic, effective, and kind assistance I have received from a large number of people and institutes in the course of my labours. My debt of gratitude to the following people is particularly great: Professor Gerhard Bendz, Professor Birger Bergh, Dr L. M. Dewailly, Dr Lennart Hakanson, Professor Dag Norberg, Professor J. Svennung, I offer my heartiest thanks Professor Elias Wessen, and Dr Ulla Westerbergh to these and to all the libraries2 that have put manuscripts or microfilms at my disposal. Thanks to generous financial support granted by the Royal Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities and the Birgitta Committee appointed by the Academy, by the Humanistic Foundation, The Swedish Humanistic Research Council and the Wessen Family Foundation I have been able, for several consecutive periods, to devote most of my time to the preparation of this work. Study of manuscripts in a number of foreign libraries has been made possible by grants received from the Hilda Kumlin Fund, the Claes and Greta Lagerfelt Foundation, the Early Swedish Text Society, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and Landshovding Per Westling's Memorial Fund. Since I was first asked by the Birgitta Committee to publish Birgitta's revela- tions several years ago, a good deal of progress has been made in the field, and I have been compelled to make certain changes in my original draft.3 In 1967 Professor Bergh published his edition of Rev. VII" and in 1971 his edition of Rev. V.' In 1972 Dr Eklund published the Sermo Angelicus6 and in 1975 the Regula Salvatoris.7 I have unfortunately been unable to use the latter publication and its results, whereas I have had the opportunity to study the above-mentioned See below, pp. 13 ff.

 VI editions of Rev. VII, Rev. V and Sermo Angelicus. I have tried to take account of these in the Introduction to my edition. However, certain inconsistencies have been unavoidable.8 It is hoped that they will be excused by the tolerant reader. The often very difficult and exacting task of translating my Swedish manuscript into English has been carried out by Mrs Caroline Treschow B. A., whom I should like to thank most warmly.

 II. General Introduction 1. THE CORPUS REUELACIONUM IN THE GHOTAN REDACTION On September 27th, 1491, Brother Petrus Ingemarsson and Lay Brother Gerard started out from Vadstena Cloister,' the mother cloister of the Birgittine order, for Liibeck to arrange for St. Birgitta's "Celestial Books of Revelations" to be printed for the first time, one hundred years after her canonization (7th October 1391). A year later, in the autumn of '49 2,1-a the editio princeps of the Revelations was ready. The printer was Bartholomaeus Ghotan, for which reason the editio princeps is usually known as the Ghotan edition (Gh). According to the postscript in Gh2 the cloister fathers, after thorough study and careful consideration, had meticulously collected and arranged all Birgitta's Revelations into this "diuinum volumen". This was done so that no one in future, by mistake or thoughtlessness — as had "The use of the word 'cloister' may strike readers as unusual. I have purposely used the three words 'convent', 'monastery' and 'cloister' in order to differentiate between such religious communi- ties as are for women alone = convent, for men alone = monastery, and for both men and women = cloister. The Birgittine establishments seem to fall into this latter category." (Translator's note); cf. Cnattingius 9 ff. la This important event is reported in DV (ed. Nygren), p. 173, s.a. 1491, in the following words: Anno domini Mcdxc primo jn die sanctorum cosme et damiani transibant fratres petrus jngemari sacerdos et gerardus laicus versus lubeck ad faciendum imprimi libros celestes reuelationum sancte birgitte. Et post annum euolutum, impressis et perfectis octingentis voluminibus jn papiro et sedecim dumtaxat in pergameno, redierunt in monasterium suum anno dominj Mcdlxxx<x>ij circa festum sancte katerine virginis et martinis. laus sit omnipotenti deo Amen. Of the two cloister brothers it is assumed that Petrus Ingemarsson, later Confessor General of Vadstena 1521-1524 (f 1526; see Silfverstolpe 98-101) was the actual editor and proof-reader whilst Gerard (t 1515; see Silfverstolpe 143 f.) would seem to have executed or at least drawn the design of the beautiful woodcuts and initials illustrating the Revelations in the Ghotan edition. Since he was of German extraction he most probably also served as interpreter during the work connected with the printing; see Collijn, Sveriges bibliografi intill dr 1606., I, 122 f.; J. V. Johansson, Fran Gutenbergbibeln till Costa Berlings saga, Stockholm (print. in Gothenburg), 1952, pp. 81 f.; A. Lindblom, Kult och konst i Vadstena kloster, Stockholm, 1965, 141-148. 2 This postscript, printed after Vita abbreuiata (see below), reads: Finit diuinum volumen omnium celestium Reuelationum preelecte sponse Christi, Sancte Birgitte de regno Swecie, A religiosis patribus originalis monsterzj Sanctarum marie et Birgitte in Watzstenis Prematuro studio et exquisita diligentia ,fin hos suprascriptos numerum et ordinem accuratius comportatum Vt si forte alique alie reuelationes sicut repertum est, beate Birgitte per errorem aut temerarie a quoquam quomodolibet ascribantur Preter has que in hoc presenti volumine, aut in vita seu legenda sancte Birgitte maiori continentur, tanquam false et erronee decernentur. Laus sit omnipotenti deo. Amen. 3 — 774372 
 
 
 
 
 2 in fact previously occurred-would ascribe to Birgitta any other revelations than those which were to be found in Gh-and in "the longer Vita or Legenda of Saint Birgitta".3 Thus with the Ghotan edition the knowledgeable monks of Vadstena had desired finally to establish what in their opinion was the correct number and order of the Revelations. The corpus Reuelacionum of the Gh redaction consists of about 700 revelations divided into the following books and writings: Liber I (Rev. I; 6o chs. with so-called declarationes [Decl.]4 attached to chs. 3, 13, 16, 17, z3, 28 and 32). Liber II (Rev. II; 3o chs. with Decl. attached to chs. 2 and 135). Liber III (Rev. III; 34 chs. with additiones [Add.]4 and declarationes attached to chs. 10-13, 19, 22 and 33). Liber IV (Rev. IV; 144 chs. with Add. and Decl. attached to chs. 16, 17, 23, 32, 34, 51, 52,6 55, 68, 71, 74,7 81, 93, 102, 107, 113, 114, 121, 122, 125, 127, 129). Liber V or Liber questionum (Rev. V; this book consists of 16 interrogationes [int.], which in their turn are divided into a number of questiones [q.] and responsiones [r.]; to this should be added 13 revelations entered among the int.).8 Liber VI (Rev. VI; 122 chs. with Add. and Decl. attached to chs. 3, 5, 9, 10, 15-20, 28, 30-32, 35, 36, 39, 41, 52, 71, 75, 94, 95, 98, 102). Liber VII (Rev. VII; 31 chs. with Add. attached to chs. 4, 5, 11, 16).9 Liber VIII or Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges (Rev. VIII; 61 chs. with Add. attached to chs. 16 and 1719.11 Regula Sancti Saluatoris (RS; 3 +31 chs.).12 3 This would seem to refer to the Vita redaction found in A&P, 73-101, the so-called "Process Vita"; see below, pp. 4 f., n. I a, and p. 152, n. I I. 4 By this is meant the explanations and supplements that began to be added to certain Revela- tions in 1380; see below, pp. 28 ff., 217-224. 5 The end of ch. 13 (Hic miles creditur fuisse dominus karolus filius sancte birgitte) should be considered as a Decl. although it is not marked Declaratio in Gh; cf. (K) pp. 105 and 106, n. 30; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, III. segregata), see (K) p. 107, n. 32. 6 On this supplement, Rev. IV 52 E-F (Dixi Concerning this supplement, Rev. IV 74 (Jste miles ... sancte Birgitte), see (K) p. 106, n. 30; cf. Wessen, Svensk medeltid, III, n. 48. 8 A modern, critical edition of Book V was published in 1971 by Birger Bergh (here abbreviated to Bergh V; see Bibliography, p. xiii); on the structure and arrangement of Rev. V see Bergh V 13 ff.; cf. below (Ua), p. 114, /1. 12. 9 A critical edition of this book was published by Birger Bergh in 1967 (see Bibliography, p. xiii); see Bergh 20 if., I 13 if. 10 The supplements to chs. 16 and 17 are not marked as Add. in Gh; see below (K), p. I to, n.69. 11 On Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges, later called Liber octauus, see below, pp. 15 ff., 102, n. 11. 12 This redaction of RS, the so-called Alfonso redaction (see below, p. 18, n. 74), is usually called Regula in prima persona because Christ speaks in the first person and dictates the rule. In this version RS takes the form of a revelation. It consists of 31 chs. preceded by a Prohemium (ch. I) and a Prologus (chs. 2-3). In this form the RS was, however, never confirmed by the Pope. On the 
 
 
 
 
 3 Sermo Angelicus de Virginis excellentia (SA; 21 chs. preceded by a prologue).13 Quattuor Orationes (IV Or. preceded by a Prohemium).14 Reuelationes Extrauagantes (Extray.; ii6 chs. preceded by a prologue and with Add. attached to chs. 13, 15, 22, 33, 55 15).16 Besides these Birgittine works Gh contains a Prologus magistri Mathie (Prol. M.) written by Birgitta's Swedish father confessor Magister Mathias, Canon of Lin- koping,17 and an Epistola solitarii ad reges (ES) written by Birgitta's Spanish confessor, the Olivetan hermit Alfonso, formerly Bishop of Jaen.18 Prol. M. is placed before Rev. I, ES before Rev. VIII. Thus the corpus Reuelacionum in Gh consists of the following sections, including these two prologues or prefaces: Prol. M., Rev. I—VII, ES, Rev. VIII, RS, SA, IV Or., Extray. Before Prol. M. the redactor (redactors?) of Gh has placed the Authentication of, the Prologue to, the beginning and the end of a Defensorium super Reuelationes celestes Sancte Birgitte, written by a fellow countryman of the above-mentioned Alfonso, the learned Dominican Cardinal Johannes de Turrecremata (Juan de Torquemada), in connection with the Basle Synod's discussion of the Revelations in the i400's.19 Between chapters 5 and 6 in the prologue to this Defensorium the Bulla canoniza- tionis beate Birgitte, issued by Pope Boniface IX on the 7th October 1391,20 and Martin V's Confirmatio canonizationis beate Birgitte, dated Florence i July 1419,21 other hand a version of the rule revised in several respects and known as Regula in tercia persona was confirmed in Urban VI's Bull of 3rd December 1378. The presentation of the rule has been changed from the first to the third person—hence the name. It was deprived of its revelation form, the prohemium and the prologus were removed and the number of chapters reduced from 31 to 24. As is rightly stressed by Cnattingius 23, the Regula in tercia persona entered in the mentioned bull was however not confirmed "as an independent rule but as statutes or constituciones which the Bridgettines were allowed to use side by side with the Augustinian rule ... it was these constitutions ... which constituted during the Middle Ages and still constitute the legal foundation of the order of St. Bridget." These two versions of RS are designated by Montag 126 as the "Fruhfassung" resp. the "approbierte Fassung".

 4 have been entered. The edition ends with a Vita abbreuiata sancte Birgitte (beginning Benedictus sit deus pater and ending nos protegat deus trinus et vnus Amen), a detailed alphabetical table of contents of the Revelations (Tabula librorum celestium ...) and an Oratio deuota ad sanctam Birgittam (beginning 0 Birgitta mater bona). Following Gh eight complete Latin editions of Birgitta's Revelations were printed: at Nuremberg in 1500 and 1517, at Rome in 1557, 1606 and 1628, at Antwerp in 16ii, at Cologne in 1628, and at Munich in 1680.22 Of the approximate 700 revelations included in the printed Latin editions the majority derive from the period 1344-1373. Thus they appeared to Birgitta during the thirty years that elapsed between her husband Ulf Gudmarsson's death (12th February 1344)22a and her own (23rd July 1373).23 In Gh the revelations vary in length from seventeen words (Rev. IV 56) to almost thirteen two-column folio pages (Rev. VIII 48). 2. THE CORPUS REUELACIONUM IN PRE-GHOTAN REDACTIONS The first printed edition of the Revelations had been preceded by several hand- written redactions and editions which we find represented in a large number of manuscripts from the end of the 1300's and—the majority—from the 1400's. I shall endeavour in this chapter to describe the most important of them. We are quite well informed as to how Birgitta's visions came to her, how they were written down and translated into Latin, and how they were examined, edited and published. The most important sources of our knowledge are the Revelations themselves, including the prologues or prefaces introducing Rev. I, V, VIII, RS, SA and Extray., Cardinal Turrecremata's above-mentioned Prologue, a letter written by Magnus Petri, Confessor General of Vadstena ca. 1384-1394,1 the father confessors' Vitae of Birgittala plus Acta et processus canonizacionis beate Birgitte For more details on these nine editions see Hollman 29-27. See below, p. 41, n. 21. 23 See, for example, Westman 8o ff., 223 ff. In the following account it is assumed that the reader is conversant with at least some of the considerable literature on Birgitta and Birgittine questions listed in my Bibliography under the names Adalsten, Bergh, Brilioth, Carlsson, Cnattingius, Collijn, Collins, Eklund-Leby, Ekwall, Flavigny, Fogelklou, Gronberger, Hammerich, Hollman, Hogman, Hojer, Jorgensen, Klemming, Klockars, Kraft, Lindblom, Lunden, Montag, Nyberg, Redpath, Schmid, Schtick, Skovgaard, Steffen, Sunden, Undhagen, Wessen, Westman. 1 See below, pp. 5, II, 13 f., footnotes 3, 27, 32, 34. la The first Vita of Birgitta was written by the two Swedish father confessors of the future saint, Petrus Olavi (Olovsson), Prior of Alvastra, and Magister Petrus Olavi of Skanninge (see below). This Life is found preserved in, among other manuscripts, cod. Upsaliensis C 25 (which originally belonged to the cloister at Vadstena) and is therefore usually called the "C 25 Vita". Upon this Vita, completed in December 2373, all other Lives of Birgitta are based, directly or indirectly; for example, the so-called Process Vita (last printed in A&P, 73-101) which was principally prepared with a view to the possible canonization of Birgitta. As Ekwall and Undhagen have shown (see below), the Process Vita is an extensively revised version of the C 25 Vita both as to form and content (the 22 22a 
 
 
 
 
 5 (A&P);2 i.e. the large collection of official documents (Acta) and testimonies (Attestaciones)3 which appeared during the preliminary inquiry that Popes Gregory XI and Urban VI had begun prior to Birgitta's canonization and during the canon- ization process 1379-138o respectively.4 "The words that were given her from God she wrote down in her mother tongue with her own hand when she was well and she had us, her father confessors,' make a very faithful translation of them into Latin. She then listened to the transla- tion and compared it with what she herself had written so that not one word was added or subtracted, but was exactly what she had heard and seen in the divine vision. But when she was too weak she would call her confessor and another scribe, especially appointed as secretary, whereupon with great devotion and fear of God and sometimes in tears, she spoke the words in her native language in a kind of tense, ecstatic trance as if she was reading from a book; and then the confessor dictated these words in Latin to the scribe, and he wrote them down there in her presence. When the words had been written down she wished to hear them and she listened very carefully and attentively".6 From this description in the Process Vita is considerably longer). The Spaniard Alfonso, one of Birgitta's father confessors (see below), was responsible for the Process Vita redaction, which can be dated to 1377-1378; see Ekwall 11 ff., 45 ff., 48 ff., 73 ff.; cf. Bergh V 15 f.; Hollman 85 ff.; Undhagen 73 ff., 81 ff. 2 Published by Dr Isak Collijn (t 1949); see Bibliography, p. xi. Of special interest and value are the attestaciones given by those belonging to Birgitta's intimate circle: Magnus Petri (A&P, 255-292), Confessor General of Vadstena ca. 1 384-1394 (f 1396 in Florence) and one of those who worked most energetically and sucessfully for Birgitta's canoniza- tion (see Cnattingius 31 ff., 56 ff.; Hojer 89, 91, 113-119; Undhagen 74 f., id., Une source, 218 ff.), Katarina, Birgitta's daughter (A&P, 303-352), Bishop Alfonso (A&P, 363-414) and Prior Petrus whose testimony, Deposicio copiosissima (Dep. cop.), is the most detailed in the whole collection (A&P, 472-562). 4 See Collijn, A&P, I ff.; Hojer jot ff.; cf. above p. 3, n. 20; E. W. Kemp, Canonization and Authority in the Western Church, Oxford, 1948, 128 ff. 5 Since the section from the Process Vita here cited was written by Bishop Alfonso, "us, her father confessors" would seem reasonably to have also included Alfonso; consequently he too should have translated revelations from Swedish into Latin. This, however, appears to have been very unlikely since Alfonso almost certainly knew no Swedish. What does seem certain is that, at Bir- gitta's request, he wrote out revelations which the Swedish confessors had already translated into Latin. This is apparent from Alfonso's own testimony, A&P, 384, 9 ff.: Quam reuelacionem (sc. Rev. VII zo) narrauit (sc. Birgitta) ... testi loquenti et confessoribus suis predictis, quam reuelacionem domina Brigida statim scripsit in uulgari suo sicut et alias reuelaciones scribere solebat, et postmodum confessores eius translatarunt eam in latinum, sicut de ahjs reuelacionibus facere solebant. Et dixit ipse testis, quod ipse scripsit eam de mandato dicte domine Brigide, quam statim ipsa tradidit eidem fratri (sc. Martino de Aragonia). Cf. A&P, 372, 3o f.; 373, 8 ff.; 381, 17 f. In connection with the transcription of these revelations—as with others—Alfonso has most probably revised the Latin text found in the Swedish confessors' translation. Alfonso's testimony should be compared with what Prior Petrus relates in Dep. cop., 524, 15-17: dixit iste testis (sc. Prior Petrus), quod dominus Alfonsus heremita fuit eciam scriptor reuelacionum ex ore et ex precepto domine Brigide. 6 Process Vita, A&P, 84, 25 ff.: verba diuinitus ei data scribebat in lingua sua materna manu sua propria, quando erat sana, et faciebat illa translatari in lingua latina fidelissime a nobis confessoribus suis et postea ascultabat illa cum scriptura sua, quam ipsa scripserat, ne vnum verbum ibi plus adderetur uel deficeret, nisi que ipsa in visione diuinitus audierat et viderat. Si vero erat infirma, vocabat confessorem 
 
 
 
 
 6 Process Vita and from similar statements in the above-mentioned sources it is evident that Birgitta usually wrote down her revelations herself in Swedish after which she had one of her confessors translate them into Latin.7 At times she dic- tated them to her confessor8 who, if we are to believe the information in the et scriptorem suum secretarium ad hoc specialiter deputatum, et tunc ipsa cum magna deuocione et timore Dei et aliquando cum lacrimis referebat ei verba illa in uulgari suo cum quadam attenta eleuacione mentali, quasi si legeret in libro, et tunc confessor dicebat illa verba in lingua latina illi scriptori, et ille scribebat illa ibidem in sua presencia, et postea cum erant verba conscripta, ipsa volebat illa ascultare et ascultabat valde diligenter et attente. This detailed but somewhat verbose description of how the Revelations were written down and translated into Latin is quoted by Kraft i cn f.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 78; Westman 5 f. and by others; cf. J. Lindblom, Prophecy in Ancient Israel, 24. 7 See, for example, Rev. V prol.: 14 (ed. Bergh): Ipsa (sc. Birgitta) statim scripsit eum (sc. librum questionum, i.e. Rev. V) in lingua sua, quem translatauit confessor eius (sc. prior Petrus) in lingua litte- rali, prout alios libros reuelacionum translatare solitus erat; ASP, 270, 8 ff. (Magnus Petri); 328, (Katarina); 384, 9 ff. (Alphonsus); see above, n. 5; Dep. cop., 509, 7 ff., 512, 4 ff., 518, i8 ff. (Prior Petrus); ES 3 B (ex.): ipsa domina reuelaciones scribebat ... ex precepto christi in lingua sua gothica, ideo ex eodem precepto christi iste prior translatauit de illa lingua sua materna in latinum omnes libros et istum presentem (sc. Librum celestis imperatoris ad reges, i.e. Rev. VIII; see above, p. 2, n. I) eidem domine diuinitus reuelatos. Here Alfonso explicitly says that it was Prior Petrus who translated a 11 the Revelation books; on the whole this is probably correct; cf. above, footn. 5; below, p. i; Extray. 48-49; Kraft ioi ff.; Schiick 37-39, n. 44; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 78 ff. Alfonso's informa- tion that Birgitta wrote down her Revelations in lingua sua gothica may seem a trifle perplexing to a modern reader. The choice of the adjective gothica instead of Sue(ti)ca appears, however, quite natural if one considers the fact that to the Spaniard Alfonso—as to southerners in general during the Middle Ages—Gothi(cus), Gothia etc. were without doubt not only better known, but also renowned in a way that Sueci(a), Sue(ti)cus etc. were not. The kingdom of Spain had once been founded by Goths who, according to tradition, had emigrated from Gothia, i.e. Gataland in southern Sweden. In the chapter entitled "Die gothische Tradition im Spanien der Westgoten and der Folgezeit" in J. Svennung's book Zur Geschichte des Goticismus, Uppsala, 1967, p. 32, it is stated that "Nicht nur die kOnigliche Familie, sondern die Spanier aller Klassen wollten sich gern gothischer Abstammung ruhmen."; cf. ib., pp. 21 ff., 26 ff., 71 ff., passim; below (K), pp. ioz f., n. 12. In his testimony given during Birgitta's canonization process, Alfonso remarks (16 Sept. 1379) that he audiuit dici a domino Petro Olauj et a domino priore confessoribus domine Brigide et a pluribus alzjs, quod domina Brigida fuit de ... regali progenie nata, videlicet de genere Go ttorum (A& P, 363, 24-28). Alfonso was very eager to draw attention to Birgitta's royal, Gothic origins. This is evident, for instance, from certain additions that he made when revising the C 15 Vita text for the Process Vita. For example sponsa Christi is amplified to sancte memorie domina Brigida, principissa Nericie de regno Swecie, sponsa Christi (A&P, 74, 6 f.), and to the information in C 15 Vita on Birgitta's parents, qui nobiles fuerunt secundum carnem, Alfonso added quia de nobili genere r egum G ottor um birgitta ... de gener e (A& P, 74, i0). In ES 3 A (in.) Alfonso stresses that illustris domina r egum go thorum exorta et in regno Swecie, quod est ad aquilonem, nata fuit. The same thing is repeated in ES 8 A (in.), where Alfonso furthermore explains why Birgitta's distinguished descent was of such importance: nata fuit ... de illustri prosapia et patria r egum gothorum. Dignum namque erat vt quam imperator christus in sponsam acciperet et ad reges et imperatores specialem nunciam et quasi quodammodo apostolam cum suis nouis litteris et verbis euangelicis mitteret non pleb eia aut rusti- calls prosapie sed regalis propaginis et nationis staret. On Birgitta's noble birth cf. Ekwall 54 ff.; Undhagen, Un acrostiche, 91 with note 23 (where further references are to be found); Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 63 f., n. 27. 8 On such dictations of revelations see RS 29 B (ex.); Dep. cop., 519, 17 ff.; cf. above, footn. 5; Schiick 38. 
 
 
 
 
 7 Process Vita, seems to have, so to speak, simultaneously translated Birgitta's utterances into Latin for the attending secretary who immediately wrote them down in Birgitta's presence.9 As far as we know there remain only three paper leaves of Birgitta's own writings; these are kept in the Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm.'° Since the message of the Revelations to a great extent concerned persons and circumstances outside Sweden, Birgitta was most anxious to have them translated into Latin, the international language of the Middle Ages. She herself did not seriously begin to learn Latin until after 134911 when she left Sweden and went to 9 Such simultaneous translating of Birgitta's utterances given in a more or less ecstatic state must have made heavy demands on the translator and therefore probably did not occur very often. 10 The leaves consist of two autographs written down in Italy, probably in 1361 (autograph B) resp. 1367 (autograph A). The texts correspond to the end of Rev. VIII 56+Extray. 8o resp. Rev. IV 49 in the Latin version. The B autograph contains what is really a plan for a revolt against the King of Sweden, Magnus Eriksson (f 1 374). The revelation in the A autograph contains a sharp criticism of prevailing abuses within the Church (e.g. simony). The Birgitta autographs have been known to scholars since the middle of the nineteenth century. Doubt has been thrown upon their authenticity, but this has now been proved by Dr Bertil Hogman in his thorough and ingenious investigation, Heliga Birgittas originaltexter, Uppsala, 1951 (see above, Bibiliography, p. xix); cf. G. Carlsson, `Heliga Birgittas upprorsprogram', in Samlingar och studier utg. av Svenskt Arkivsam- fund, I, Archivistica et mediaevistica Ernesto Nygren oblata, Stockholm, 1965, pp. 86-102. Birgitta's autographs, which were aquired by the Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm in 1954, were originally kept at Vadstena Cloister. These, however, were certainly not the only original drafts by Birgitta that the cloister had in its possession. Certain revelations are found in a so-called Birgittine-Norse version in cod. Skokloster 5 from ca. 1400 and now kept in the Svenska Riksarkivet, Stockholm. To a great extent the text of these gives the impression of being nearer the original than that of the corresponding Latin version. Thus there is reason to believe that the Birgittine-Norse texts were copied in Vadstena from Birgitta's original draft or from other copies very close to it. The Birgittine- Norse revelations have most recently and most thoroughly been discussed by Elias Wessen in Svensk medeltid, 85-152; cf. Kraft 43-51; Westman 63-72. After Birgitta's Revelations had eventually been translated into Latin, they began to be translated back into Swedish in Vadstena at the end of the 1300's so that they should also be accessible to those who did not understand Latin. Conse- quently this Old Swedish version is secondary to the Latin one. On the basis of a few manuscripts G. E. Klemming, librarian in Stockholm, published the Old Swedish text in 1857-1884. This edition (Heliga Birgittas uppenbarelser. Efter gamla handskrifter utg. of G. E. Klemming, 1-5 [SFSS, 14]; below cited as BU) obviously does not fulfil modern criteria for a scholarly edition prepared according to critical principles. A new edition based on a thorough study and assessment of all known Old Swedish manuscripts containing the Revelations is therefore most desirable. On the relationship between the Latin and the Old Swedish versions of the Revelations see Bergh V 16 ff.; Hollman 100-106; Kraft 17 ff.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 73 ff.; Westman 63-72; cf. Gosta Holm, Epoker och prosastilar, Lund, 1967, 65-72. A complete—but by no means perfect—translation of the Revelations into modern Swedish was published in 1957-1959 by Tryggve Lunden; this was mainly based on the Ghotan edition (see Bibliography, p. xxi: Lunden). On translations into other languages see I. Collijn, Sveriges bibliografi, i600-talet, 1, Uppsala, 1 942-1944, 84 ff.; Klemming, BU, 5, 209-233; Steffen, SBL, 4 (1924), 459 f. " This is apparent from details given in the Vitae of Birgitta and in A &P; see Colledge 23 f.; Klockars 20 if.; Kraft 98 ff.; Undhagen 88-90, 128 f.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 8o ff., where the ques- tion of Birgitta's studies and knowledge of Latin is discussed. During the canonization process, wit- nesses had to answer among other questions one on Birgitta's knowledge of Latin (art. 38). From the 
 
 
 
 
 8 Italy.12 Consequently, in order to realize her plans, Birgitta needed the help of people with, among other tings, a knowledge of Latin. Her main assistants were four of her father confessors:13 Magister Mathias, answers it is evident that Magister Petrus Olavi of Skanninge was her principal teacher in Latin grammar and also that she made great progress in a short space of time so that she could sp e a k and understrand Latin fairly well; but it is not possible to establish how conversant she became with Latin during her 24 years in Italy. Since she is given as having been very anxious to check the father confessors' translations of the revelations (see above, pp. 5 f. with footn. 6), she would probably have been eager to acquire sufficient knowledge of the language so as to make such a revision meaningful. Probably Birgitta attained hardly any appreciable ability in writing Latin herself. Indeed, the cramped "wax-tablet style" of Birgitta's autographs from the 1360's (see above, p. 7, n. i o) indicates someone unused to writing (see Hagman 16 f., 70), and may well give us reason to suspect that Birgitta did not use her pen as often as her lips in making the contents of the revela- tions known to others. For instance, according to her own statement she had "narrated" the whole Regula Salvatoris to a monk ( = Prior Petrus) who wrote it down as rapidly as possible: omnes regule articulos, et verba que in eis continentur, cuidam viro religioso amico dei enarr a u i, qui omnia quamcitius conscripsit (RS 29 B [ex.]). According to information I have found in a Vadstena manuscript from the first half of the I400's, the reason she did not write down RS herself was that at the time the Rule was revealed to her in the monastery of Alvastra (ca. 1345) she "had no proficiency in, or experience of writing". By this was presumably meant lack of ability and practice in writing Latin. This information was given in a long letter, the original of which seems to have been written at Vadstena in the summer of 1427. The letter, which is included in cod. Ups. C 74, ff. 123r-139v (according to a later foliation: 128r-144v), is addressed to the Birgittine convent of Syon, in England, whence three letters had arrived at Vadstena containing questiones perplexas multas tenuitatem rudis et obtusi ingenioli nostri longe transcendentes (f. 123 et altas et nobis insolubiles [128]r, 4-6). Two Syon monks, Robert Belle and Thomas Sterington, presented themselves in Vadstena Cloister at Easter 1427 in order to obtain answers to these questions; see Cnattingius 159 ff.; Hollman 38-40; HOjer 188 f. (with footn. 4), 257 f.; Schiick, Ant. tidskr., 5, 423 f.; cf. below (L), p. 183. Who actually drafted the answers to these awkward questions is not given. I presume that it was the then Confessor General, Gervinus Petri (see Silfverstolpe 84 f.), or one of the two immediately preceding confessors general, Ulpho Birgeri and Ericus Iohannis resp. (see Silfverstolpe 81-84). To the question whether there was a copy of the Regula Salvatoris written down by Birgitta herself and stating that it had been revealed to her by God, the following interesting quia answer is given: scriptura regule sue manus non habetur nec vt creditur vnquam habebatur regula in monasterio alzvastro fuit sibi reuelata et pro tempore illo artem seu periciam scribendi non habuit sed illam in roma acquisiuit et ibi gramaticam ex precepto dei didicit (f. 128 [133]r, 28-32). Consequently, according to a tradition of Vadstena Cloister there never had been a transcription of the Rule written in Birgitta's own hand; cf. below, p. 12, n. 31; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 49 ff• 12 At this period large groups of pilgrims from the whole of Europe made their way to Rome in order to partake of the Indulgence that was being granted to believers during the Jubilee Year 1350. What induced Birgitta to set out for Rome was probably the hope of having her Rule con- firmed by the Pope, who she hoped would return during the Holy Year from his "Babylonian captivity" in Avignon; see Hojer 58 ff.; Klockars, Bishop Hemming, 167 ff.; Steffen XVII ff.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 47 if. 18 In Dep. Cop. two other persons are mentioned as having been Birgitta's confessors: a priest by the name of Guido, who would seem to have been her confessor in 1340, and Swenungus, Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Varnhem in the diocese of Skara, who was Birgitta's confessor on her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela 1341-1342; see Dep. cop., 486, 4 ff.; 482, 17 ff.; Gottfrid 
 
 
 
 
 9 Canon of Linkoping Cathedral, Petrus Olavi, Prior of the Cistercian abbey of Alvastra, Magister Petrus Olavi of Skanninge, a secular priest, and the Spaniard Alfonso Pecha de Vadaterra, formerly Bishop of Jaen, later an Olivetan hermit. I shall briefly describe their relations with Birgitta and their participation in the writing down, translating into Latin, revising and publishing of the Revelations as these questions have previously been discussed by other scholars; on the whole correctly, as far as I can judge. As early as 1333 Mathias, Birgitta's first father confessor,14 is mentioned as being Magister and Canon of Linkoping. As Gottfrid Carlsson has shown,15 Mathias is without doubt identical with a certain Mathias Ouidi (in Swedish Mats Ovidsson) mentioned in three supplications and papal bulls, dated 26 February, 1343. He was then magister in artibus and in sacra theologia bacallarius. The founda- tions of his learning in theology and the humanities were most probably laid in Paris. When and where be became magister in theologia is not known.16 Among other works he wrote textbooks on rhetoric and poetry (Testa nucis and Poetria resp.),17 homiletic works (Copia exemplorunz, Homo conditus, Concordancie super totam bill am [of this work only fragments remain]), a commentary on the Apocal- ypse (Super Apocalypsim) and—which is of special interest in this context—an essay in defence of the divine origin of Birgitta's revelations, the so-called Prologus magistri Mathie (Prol. M.).18 We do not know for certain when Birgitta and Mathias first became acquainted. According to Prior Petrus, Mathias was already Birgitta's confessor before her husband died (26th February, 1344).19 After the death of her husband, Birgitta resided in and near the Cistercian monastery of Alvastra not far from Vadstena and Linkoping. During this period, ca. 1344-1348, Mathias and Birgitta met frequently. His influence on her religious development, as on the content and form of her revelations, was no doubt very significant Carlsson, 'Master Mattias fran Linkoping.

XXXIX; Westman 13, n. 3. 14 The information that Mathias was Birgitta's primus confessor is given, for instance, by Magnus Petri (see above, p. 5, n. 3 with ref.) and Katarina, Birgitta's daughter, in their testimonies during the canonization process; see A&P, 267, 32 f.; 324, 15 f. 15 Carlsson, 'Master Mattias fran Linkoping' (see above, n. 13), pp. 1 ff. 16 Cf.

 I0 during these years.20 He was obviously himself deeply impressed with her persona- lity and the contents of her revelations.21 In her first major revelation, the so-called "summoning revelation" this was most probably in 1344—Birgitta was instructed to turn to Magister Mathias and re- late the contents of the revelation to him.22 So she did. At the same time Birgitta gave Mathias the task of making the revelation known to others. Since its message was intended for all sinners in Sweden, it was natural that the revelation was first pub- lished in Swedish. That this was really the case was not, however, known to schol- ars until 1961, when Dr. Jan Liedgren, Svenska Riksarkivet, Stockholm, publish- ed Magister Matthias' svenska kungOrelse om Birgittas forsta stora uppenbarelse. In this work Liedgren gives an account of his discovery of some fragments of parchment from 1359 kept in the Svenska Riksarkivet. The text of these fragments, which Lied- gren edits with certain supplements on pp. III-113, is in Old Swedish and consists of the above-mentioned revelation preceded by a short introduction written in the first person by Mathias. This Old Swedish version of the revelation is incomplete but the preserved text agrees in the main with the Latin version of the same revelation found included in Prol. M.: 33-40. The Latin translation of the revelation was most probably done by Mathias himself when (ca. 1346) he wrote his comprehen- sive Prologue on account of Birgitta's revelations, the Prologus magistri Mathie, which has its place before Rev. I in the corpus Reuelacionum.23 In 1348 Birgitta's and Mathias' ways seem to have parted. For in that year Mathias, according to Birgittine tradition, accompanied King Magnus Eriksson on his crusade against Russia.24 He probably died in 1350, presumably in Stock- holm.25 20 Westman II states that Mathias is never mentioned as chronicler of Birgitta's revelations. There is, however, at least one report to the effect that Mathias wrote down revelations, too, since in the Celeste Viridarium, a compilation of the Revelations made by Alfonso, Birgitta says: supradicto viro magistro in theologia sancto seni confessori meo hec et alia, que in spiritu in visionibus perceperam, enarraui. Qui omnia statim conscripsit ... (this passage is found printed in Schtick 51, at the foot of the page). I can see no reason for doubting the accuracy of Alfonso's information. Strangely enough there seems to be no indication that Mathias also translated revelations into Latin (cf. Colledge 22). However, the revelation included in Prol. M.: 33 - 40 has most probably been trans- lated by Mathias. On the Celeste Viridarium see Kraft 131-134; Schiick 21, 48 - 53; Westman 27 f.; cf. below, p. 24, and (L), p. 184, n. 13. 21 See Stromberg 19 ff.; Sunden 46 ff. 22 See the Process Vita, A&P, 8o f.; cf. Ekwall 4o ff.; Kraft 114 f.; Schiick io f.; Westman 103 IT. The revelations that Birgitta had had before she left Sweden in 1349 had always been confided to Magister Mathias and Prior Petrus. What steps should be taken in the light of these revelations was decided by Magister Mathias, if we are to believe the Prior's information in Dep. cop., 489, 3o ff.: quas habuerat in patria Swecie, semper eas reuelauerat magistro Mathie et isti testi Reuelaciones loquenti ... et obediebat super hoc quicquid determinabatur a dicto magistro Mathia. That Birgitta engaged a man of Mathias' scholarship and authority as assistant shows a sound judgement. 23 See below, pp. 38-5o. 24 See Stromberg 21 ff.; cf. Liedgren 107 f.; Rev. I 57, 20-22 in the crit. app. 25 See StrOmberg 23 ff. (with further ref.) and Liedgren 207 f. 
 
 
 
 
 II As Birgitta's secundus confessor is named in A&P, 268, I ff., Prior Petrus of Alvastra (01390). She had come to know him, too, during the period she spent in and around Alvastra monastery (ca. 1344-1348). To him was allotted the responsible task of translating the revelations into Latin. He was at this time—ca. 1344—Sub-Prior of Alvastra. Excepting a few breaks in 1349, 1354, 1360 (?), 1363 (?), 1365 and 1367 (?), Prior Petrus acted as Birgitta's translator until her death in 1373.26 Generally Magister Petrus of Skanninge (01378) who belonged to Birgitta's most immediate circle from 1348 acted as his deputy.27 When Birgitta had been living in Italy for about twenty years, she became acquainted with an exiled Spaniard who had resigned his episcopate in Jaen and become a hermit. His name, one I have mentioned many times already, was Alfonso (01389).28 Birgitta seems to have very soon realized what a considerable amount of help she could have from this man who among his many influential friends numbered popes, cardinals, royalty, nobility etc. As early as 137o he was commissioned by Birgitta to have books containing her revelations written and copied. Up to this point her revelations had been kept secret. 29 This assignment 26 See Extray. 48; cf. Extray. 45-46; Dep. cop., 510-512; Prol. M.: 42-44; Kraft, HT, 1927, morie- p. 25 with footn. 1; Schilck 14 ff.; Westman 15-17; cf. DV (ed. Nygren), p. 14, s. a. 1390: beate byrgitte. batur frater petrus prior aluastri translator et conscriptor maxime partis reuelacionum quando ipse testis non erat 27 Dep. cop., 511 f.: aliqua scripsit dominus Petrus consocius eius cum ea. Cf. Extray. 48: 14; DV (ed. Nygren), p. 9, s.a. 1378: ... obiit magister petrus primus confessor generalis in vastenom. hic magister et confessor fuit sancte byrgitte. Magister Petrus has most probably translated, amongst other works, Sermo Angelicus (SA) into Latin, a work which he later included as lessons in his Cantus sororum, a Maria Office which he himself arranged in order to be used by the nuns in Vadstena; see Westman 17 f.; Eklund-Leby 18 ff.; Undhagen, Un acrostiche, 96 f. with note 45 (where further references are to be found). When Magister Petrus Olavi became Bir- gitta's confessor, he was warden of the Holy Ghost House (Helgeandshuset) at Skanninge. After his return home from Italy in 1374, he seems to have acted as father superior to the Vadstena monks and their virtual leader until his death in 1378—however without ever having been formally elected or inaugurated as Confessor General; see Hojer 88 f.; cf. Collijn, A&P, 675 f.; Kraft 93; Schiick, Ant. tidskr., 5, 295-312 (De vita domini Petri Olavi), 415 ff.; Silfverstolpe 77 f. The cloister's first Confessor General after its consecration in the autumn of 1384 seems to have been Magnus Petri who retired from his office in 1394; see HOjer 89 f.; Silfverstolpe 79 f.; above pp. 4 f., n. 1 and 3; cf. primus confessor generalis post magistrum DV (ed. Nygren), p. 22, s.a. 1396: Frater magnus petri petrum confessorem sancte byrgitte in monasterio vastenis fuit ...; A&P, 33o, where the following marginal note in cod. S (= cod. Holm. A 14; see A CIP, pp. IV ff.) is printed: Magnus Petri, qui fuit primus generalis confessor monasterii in Vazstenom. On Magnus Petri cf. below, pp. 33-36. 28 For a more detailed account of Alfonso see particularly Eric Colledge, `Epistola solitarii ad reges: Alphonse of Pecha as Organizer of Birgittine and Urbanist Propaganda' (Medieval Studies, Gehilfe der XVIII [ 1 956 ], 19-49); Collijn, Birgittinska gestalter, 116 ff.; Michael Seidlmayer, hl. Birgitta von Schweden: Alfons von Jaen' (Historisches Jahrbuch im Auftrage der GOrres-Gesell- schaft, 5o, 1930, 1-18); Westman 19 ff.; cf. Cnattingius 39 ff.; Ekwall 51 ff.; Schiick 18 ff. As for the date of his death, 1389, see Colledge 27, n. 49. 29 This is evident from the following words in the Process Vita, A&P, 98, 3-11: ibi tunc in Monteflasconis virgo Maria precepit ei (sc. Birgittae), quod ipsa diceret cuidam presbytero heremite Alfonso sibi noto et amico ex parte sua, quod ipse scriberet et copiaret libros reuelacionum, que sibi date fuerant diuinitus, que quidem reuelaciones vsque tunc secrete tenebantur. Quod in morte eiusdem domine 
 
 
 
 
 I2 was renewed two years later, 1372, in Famagusta on Cyprus.30 It was confirmed finally in 1373 when Birgitta on her deathbed urged her Swedish confessors to relinquish to him all revelations not previously handed over.31 Briefly Alfonso's Christus confirmauit precipiens eidem domine Brigide, quod ipsa diceret suis confessoribus, vt ipsi trade- rent dicto heremite omnes reuelaciones secretas et alias, quas nondum tradiderant, vt idem heremita eas scribi faceret et ad Dei honorem et gloriam gentibus publicaret. This passage is not found in the C 15 Vita and has in all certainty been added by Alfonso himself, probably in 1377; see Ekwall 4o ff., 52 f., 72 ff., 123, lines 9 ff.; Kraft 105; cf. above, pp. 4 f., n. Ia. 30 Extray. 49: 3-4 ... ego Deus ... verba mea posui in cor tuum. Amici vero mei redegerunt ea in libros secundum graciam eis datam et colorauerunt et ornauerunt illa.

Very interesting supplementary details on the handing over of the Revelations to Alfonso etc. are found in the letter book of Vadstena Cloister, cod. A 20, in the Svenska Riksarkivet, Stockholm. In this manuscript there is, among others, a letter (f. 178), probably original, written in the first person plural to a certain Venerabilis et in christo dilecte confrater who had earlier written and asked for an answer to certain questions concern- ing Regula Saluatoris (f. 178r, I ff.). From a note at the foot of f. 178" (fratribus vlphoni et erico in Monasterio watzstenensi detur), it is apparent that the letter was to be handed over to Brothers Ulf and Erik in Vadstena Cloister. This refers without doubt to Ulpho Birgeri who took vows in 1407 and was Confessor General 1423-1426 (t 1433; see Silfverstolpe 82-84; cf. Hollman 43 f., 55, 97; above p. 8, n. I I) and to Ericus Iohannis, Confessor General 1401-1423 (f 1447; see Silfver- stolpe 81 f.; cf. pp. 18 f.). In the letter, which must have been written before 19 Dec., 1433, the date of Ulf's death, we find the following on f. 178r, 27 precepit (sc. Birgitta moriens) domino petro priorj qui Primus reuelacionum suarurn conscriptor extiterat vt ipsas reuelaciones vna cum I r egula saluatoris in eis contenta prout eas de wlgari in latinum ipse transtulerat I domino alf onso quondam gienensi episcopo tr ader et r elegendas quas ipse reuerenter suscipiens et I vna cum doctoribus tunc in romana curia presentibus diligenter examinans eas per I libros et capitula distinctas registrauit ex quibus plures libros conscriptos principibus ad I diuersa regna transmisit quorum vnum misit pro exemplari et memoriali perpetuo huic loco I watzstenensi ipsamregulam saluatoris in prima persona continentern prout beate birgitte fuerat I reuelata.

According to the anonymous writer of the letter, Prior Petrus gave Alfonso to read both the Revelations and Regula Saluatoris, which Prior Petrus had himself translated from "the language of the people" (= Swedish) into Latin. Together with some other learned men of the Curia, Alfonso scrutinized them and arranged them into books and chapters. Subsequently he had copies sent to princes in different countries. He sent the original copy of the Revelations including the Regula Saluatoris in prima persona (see above, pp. 2 f., n. 12; cf. p. 8, n. I I), just as it had been revealed to Birgitta, to Vadstena as "an eternal monument"; cf. below, p. 18; Kraft 63, n. 2 and Hojer 65, n. 2 (where part of the letter is found printed); Silfverstolpe's supposition (Om kyrkans 
 
 
 
 
 13 task consisted in examining all the visions with regard both to form and content; in doing this, special attention was to be paid to clarity and orthodoxy. Like the Swedish confessors, Alfonso was given a certain amount of freedom to "colour stylistically" the revelations, for the publication of which he was to be responsible. Consequently Alfonso was the editor-in-chief of the first edition of the Revela- tions. This Alfonso redaction was ready in 13 7 7. Several copies of this edition were presented to the members of the commission appointed by Pope Gregory XI to examine the revelations during Birgitta's canonization process.32 This, as it appears, rather thorough investigation of the Revelations went well for the Birgittines and resulted in a proposal for the canonization of Birgitta. This was put forward on 29th May, 1377, by a member of the examining commission, Iohannes de Hispania, magister in sacra pagina.33 Before there had been time to make a definite decision on the question of canonization Pope Gregory died, 27th March, 1378. In that year his successor, Urban VI, had to take over the whole of the canonization proceedings. A new examination of the Revelations had to take place. Urban VI therefore appointed a new commission. For the second time a number of copies of the Revelations were presented for examination.34 Whether these copies represented the same redaction angrepp, 5 ff.) that the letter was an account composed by one of the older monks as a guide to younger monks in their research on the Revelations is erroneous, as should be obvious from the discussion above; cf. HOjer 6o, n. 1. 32 The copies to be examined were handed over to the Pope by Birgitta's daughter Katarina, Prior Petrus and Magister Petrus. Alfonso was himself one of the members of the commission. The most important source of our knowledge about the examination of the Revelations under Popes Gregory XI and Urban VI is a letter written by the Confessor General, Magnus Petri (epistola venerabilis viri, fratris Magni Petri, generalis confessoris monasterij Watzstenensis, contra calumpniantes sanctissimas reuelaciones beate Birgitte ...), sometime between 1384-1391 (cf. below, n. 34). The letter was found by Undhagen in codd. T and Ga (see below, pp. 58 and 127) and published—with an introduction—in Eranos, LVIII [1960], 214-226. In this letter, on which the majority of ch. 1 in Turrecramata's Prologue to the Revelations (see above, p. 3) is indirectly based, Magnus Petri relates, amongst other things, the following: anno Domini m° ccc° lxxvij° ... Reuelaciones, in pluribus voluminibus conscripte, quia sic commodius a pluribus inspici potuerunt, presentate fuerunt per manus ... domine Katerine, nate beate Birgitte, fratris Petri, prioris Aluastri, et domini Petri Olaui, confessoris prefate domine Birgitte, sanctissimo patri, domino Gregorio XJ°. Qui ... statim eas assignauit et commisit examinandas circumspectissimis et peritissimis viris, ...; jtem venerabili patri, domino Alphonso ... (Undhagen, Une source, 221 f., §§ 5 ff.; cf. ib., 215 ff.). Cf. Hojer 65 f., 207 ff.; Kraft 65 f.; 205; Westman 21 f. 33 See Undhagen, Une source, 222, §§ VIII f.; Hojer 107 f.; cf. above, n. 32; Ekwall 126 f. 34 See Undhagen, Une source, 222 ff., §§ X ff. This time the Revelations were presented to the Pope by Birgitta's daughter Katarina, Prior Petrus, a certain Brother Nicolaus Andree of Vadstena and Magnus Petri. Nicolaus Andree is probably identical with Katarina's chaplain Nicolaus (de Her- seme) whom Alfonso mentions in a letter to Archbishop Birger Gregersson, written on 15th January 1378 (published in full in Ekwall 128-130; cf. Hojer 108; Undhagen 28, n. 1; Westman 21, n. 5); see Ekwall 129; Silfverstolpe 150 f.; Collijn, ACIP, 672 (with references); cf. Mier 66; AS, Oct., IV, 407 f., 465; Silfverstolpe 203 f. A number of questions concerning the appointment, composition and work of this commission need a more detailed investigation; cf. Bergh 17, n. 6; Ekwall I15 ff.; Hojer 65 f., 107 ff.; Kraft 65 f., 105; Westman 21 f., n. 6. Among the members of the commission 
 
 
 
 
 1 4 as Alfonso had drafted in 1 377 or that of a somewhat revised edition, we do not know for certain. Nothing is mentioned about this in Magnus Petri's letter. The Revelations handed over to Gregory XI are referred to in the words Reuelaciones celestes ... in pluribus voluminibus conscripte35 and those Urban VI received are only referred to as ipse Reuelaciones.36 Since the first examining commission does not seem to have had any objections to the revelations they had been given to examine,37 it would seem unlikely that Alfonso would have found it necessary to revise the text of the 1 377 redaction. I assume therefore that both commissions were given copies of exactly the same redaction and recension to examine.38 In the following account I call this the first Alfonso redaction. A. The First Alfonso Redaction It is not known whether the large collection of revelations Alfonso had been given to revise and publish was already divided into books by the Swedish father confessors—principally Prior Petrus.39 What is certain is that according to the traditions of Vadstena Cloister it was Alfonso who divided the revelations into books and chapters and gave the chapters their rubrics.40 I have not found any were Alfonso, Cardinal Adam Easton of England (see below, pp. 127, n. 7; 184, n. 15) and Magister Matheus de Cracouia. The latter seems to have presented the fourth proposition regarding Birgitta's canonization (see Undhagen, Une source, 223, § XV), probably in 1385 or 1386 (see Westman 291; cf. ib., 22, n. 5; Ekwall io8, n. 19; 115 ff.; Hojer 108 f.). These years can therefore be established as terminus post quem for the writing of Magnus Petri's letter. Concerning Matheus de Cracouia see below, pp. 31 f., and 65 f. 35 See Undhagen, Une source, 221, §§ V f. 36 See Undhagen, Une source, 223, § XII. 37 See Undhagen, Une source, §§ IX and XVI. 38 Westman also seems to be of this opinion, since he considers cod. B as "a copy, even if not at first hand, of the original Alfonso edition" (Westman 22 f., n. 2). The fact is that B seems to be an indirect copy of an original representing the second Alfonso redaction of the Revelations; see below, pp. 25, 170-174. 39 Schtick (pp. 19 f.) and Westman (pp. 23, 44) maintain that the Revelations were already divided into seven books when Alfonso began the work of revising them, an opinion that Kraft 59 ff. completely repudiates. In his opinion, Alfonso carried out the division into books; cf. id., 55 if• 40 This is clear, for instance, from a detailed prologue to a collection of so-called Reuelaciones extrauagantes in cod. Holm. A 22 ( ---=V in Hollman 56 ff.) written in Vadstena during the first half of the 1400's. In this prologue printed in Hollman 114 f. (earlier printed in Westman 303 f.), the following information is given (§§ 2-3): domina Birgitta ...,imperio Christi iussa fuit omnes reuelaciones fideliter conscriptas—venerabili patri domino Alphonso (domino sibi factas—per priorem Petrum Alphonso in marg.), episcopo quondam Giennensi, ..., ad certos libros redigendas et per distincta quod et in effectum prosecutum est. Nam memo- librorum capitula distinguendas assignare reuelaciones, ad manus sibi presentatas, ad octo libros satis magnos ratus magister Alphonsus redegit et certis capitulis discreuit et rubricas singulis librorum capitulis succincte edidit et preposuit, sicut nunc stant egregie et per multas per orbem ecclesias sunt transcripte, dilatate et transmisse. Cf. Hollman 113 f. (the Prologue according to Gh); Kraft 63 f. In cod. Ups. C 518, 
 
 
 
 
 15 weighty argument refuting the validity of this. A circumstance that indicates its accuracy is that in his testimony (A &P, pp. 363-414) Alfonso more than any other witness in the canonization process gives exact book and chapter numbers when referring to the Revelations. He reveals the same intimate knowledge of the different books and chapters of the Revelations in his Epistola solitari (see below). Opinion is divided as to the contents of the original Alfonso redaction. According to the prevalent theory, which was first put forward by Westm an (pp. 22 f., 44) and which is shared by We s s en (pp. xvii, xxxvii f.), Ho llman (p. 28), Bergh (pp. 17 f.) and some other scholars, the redaction had the following content as early as 13 7 7: Rev. I-VII (with 130 chs. in Rev. IV and 109 in Rev. VI41), ES,42 Rev. VIII (Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges ; 58 chs.),43 SA and IV Or.44 Wes tman, who obviously considers that the two examining commissions received copies of the same Alfonso redaction of the Revelations,45 bases this opinion on the fact that cod. B, which would seem to derive from one of the transcriptions supposed to have been made in Rome at the time the Revelations were being scrutinized by Urban VI's examining commission (ca. 1378-1380), has precisely this content.46 Kraft (pp. 64 ff.) shares Westman's opinion concerning B but draws the conclusion that Alfonso's redaction had the contents given by Westman, and arranged as in B not in 1377 but only in 1379, the year, according to Turrecre- mata's Prologue, when Urban VI appointed the above-mentioned examining commission and when the original of B is supposed to have been made.47 Kraft doubts that Alfonso's redaction had the same scope and arrangement as early as 13 7 7, mainly because certain manuscripts (amongst others cod. C and the y manuscripts; see below, pp. 31-33, 53-85; 174-177) "present older dispositions"— quod erat demonstrandum! "and might derive from earlier editions".48 Even more sceptical is Ek wall (pp. 82 ff., 115 ff.). Amongst other things she maintains that Rev. IV had not yet been divided into numbered chapters in Jan.- written in Vadstena in the mid 1400's (see below, p. 98, n. 2; p. 103, n. 12), it is stated (col. 10, lines 3 ff.) respecting Magister Mathias' Prologue, that: Qui quidem prologus a domino alphonso qui ordinauit et distinxit reuelaciones sancte birgitte in libros et libros in capitula positus est ante primum librum pro prologo et prohemio omnium librorum reuelacionum beate birgitte Et incipit sic Stupor et mirabilia audita cunt in terra nostra. 41 Cf. above, p. 2; below, pp. 17 ff. 42 See below, pp. 22 ff. 43 Cf. above, pp. 2 f.; below, pp. 22 ff. 44 Whether or not Prol. M. was included in this redaction these scholars do not say. However, Westman would seem—as the others do, too—to think that Prol. M. was there as a prologue to Rev. I; see below, pp. 39 ff. Addiciones and declaraciones are completely missing from this redaction, see above, p. 2, n. 4; below, pp. 28 ff., 21 7-224. 45 See above, p. 14, n. 38. 46 See above, pp. 13 f.; below, pp. 25, 170-174. 47 See above, pp. 3, 13 f., n. 32 and 34; below, pp. 16, 21 ff. 48 Kraft 64; cf.

 i6 Feb. 13 8 0,49 and doubts that Rev. VI with 109 chs. and its definite ordinal number was really included in Liber celestis (see below) before the 13 8 o'S.513 Schii ck (pp. 22 f.) is of the opinion that cod. B was identical with a transcription of the Revelations that a certain frater Petrus de Burgundia had allegedly obtained in Rome in 1379.51 From this he concludes that the Alfonso redaction had the same content and disposition as B in i 3 7 9. However, contrary to Westman and other scholars, Schack considered that Alfonso's redaction of 1377 "presumably" contained only seven books, since in the testimonies given in 1379 the seventh book is always called liber ultimus.52 As I have maintained above (p. 14), both the examining commissions under Gregory XI and Urban VI resp. received for examination transcriptions of one and the same Alfonso redaction of the Revelations. In Alfonso's and the Birgittine circle's view the canonization of Birgitta was the great goal; her revelations were one of the most important means of achieving this goal. The collection of revela- tions that had found favour with the first papal commission would, in my opinion, have been deemed by the Birgittines as being also the most suitable to submit, unchanged, to the second papal commission. What did the original Alfonso redaction contain and how were its contents arranged? In my opinion, which in the main coincides with Schack's, the corpus Reuelacionum probably consisted in this redaction of seven books, together and —in combination with an ordinal number—separately called the Liber celestis reuelacionum Dei.53 In the majority of the Revelation manuscripts and also, as Schack has pointed out, in A &P, the seventh book is called ultimus liber celestis.54 Each book was divided into chapters written out in full and supplied with rubrics (text rubrics).55 Moreover, to give the readers—in the first place the members of Ekwall 85. Ekwall 89. In another context I intend to provide a detailed and critical discussion of these and other statements of Ekwall's, which in my opinion are erroneous. I shall here only point out that in ES, which most certainly was completed before 16 Sept. i 3 7 9, Alfonso refers to all seven books in Liber celestis, to Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges and to RS, and in so doing meticulously gives also the chapter number within the respective book. I have compared ES in the oldest dated Revela- tion manuscript, Fb (written in 1386; see below, pp. 204-209), in B (see below, pp. 1 70-174), q (see below, pp. 134-137) and in r (see Bergh 36 ff.). Alfonso's references have been found to be absolutely correct, with a few exceptions that can be explained by errors in transcription. As a rule when referring to Rev. VII, in vltimo libro celesti is used in the manuscripts examined, whilst Gh in the corresponding place has in septimo libro celesti, which is noteworthy; cf. below, pp. 19 ff.; Bergh 17 ff.; Bergh V 13 ff. 51 See below, pp. 25 f., 171-173. 52 Schiick ig; cf. id., p. 48, n. 53 and n. 54. 55 See below, the Incipits and Explicits to the resp. Book of the Rev. in the MSS., pp. 148-152, 154-164, 173-195. Cf. Bergh V 47-50; Ekwall go ff.; Westman 8, n. I . 54 See below, the Incipits and Explicits of Rev.

 17 the two examining commissions—an outline of the contents, the chapter rubrics to these books were collected into a list (list rubrics) entered before the respective books or possibly entered in a series before Rev. 1.56 However, immediately preceding Rev. I, Prol. M. was placed not only as a prologue to Book I, but to the whole of Liber celestis.57 Alfonso himself wrote a shorter prologue to Rev. V.58 The order and extent of the books in this redaction were the following: Prol. M., Rev. I (6o chs.), II (3o chs.), III (34 chs.), IV (13o chs.),59 V,60 VI (109 chs.),61 VII (3i or 3z chs.).62 What grounds are there for assuming that the original Alfonso redaction had precisely this extent? I believe I can best answer this question by giving an account of what I know of Vadstena Cloister's principal copy of Alfonso's original redaction of the Revelations, the so-called Liber Alphonsi. In cod. K, written in Vadstena ca. 138o-1391,63 there is in the upper margin of fol. I78vb the following rubric to a collection of supplements to Rev. VII 16: Sequencia vsque ad xvij capitulum non habet liber alphonsi.64 In the same manu- script there is written in the margin to fol. I6Ira beside a supplement to Rev. VI 75: Jstud non habet alphonsus,65 in the margin to fol. I66va at the end of Rev. VI 109: Finis vj" libri secundum alphonsum,66 and at the end of Rev. IV 13o: 56 See below, pp. 20, 32, 148-165, 1 73-1 95, 206-208, 225 f.; cf. (0) p. 185; Bergh 87-93; Bergh V 68 ff. 57 This is apparent from, for example, Alfonso's statement in ES 3 B (ex.): De quo quidem reli- gioso (sc. priore Petro) mentio fit in prologo libri celestis in fine (= Prol. M.: 42-44). Without giving his source, Alfonso cites some other passages from Mathias' prologue in ES, i.e. in ES 3 A (Prol. M., 76-78), B (Prol. M.: is), E (Prol. M.: 16-17), 6 L (Prol. M.: 27-28, 18, 29). Cf. A&P 375, 31 f.: prologus ... super primo libro celesti ...; the Process Vita, ACIP, 78, 15 ff.: magister Mathias ..., qui ... composuit prologum librorum celestium reuelacionum ...; Dep cop., 477, 3 f.: composuit (sc. magister Mathias) ... prologum primi libri celestis ...; 485, 23-25: super hoc sunt facta ... duo prohemia, scilicet prohemium primi libri celestis et libri celestis jmperatoris ad reges ...; cod. Ups. C 518, col. 1o, lines 3 ff. (see above, p. 15, n. 4o at the end). 58 See Bergh V 15 ff., 68 f., 97 f.; Westman 24. The prologue to Rev. VII appearing in the so- called y MSS. and in some other manuscripts would seem not to have been drafted by Alfonso and in my opinion was not found included in the Alfonso redactions; cf. Bergh 22, 97, 113; West- man 24, n. 3; 266, n. 2; below, p. 32. 59 We can infer, from the addition Et hic est finis quarti libri secundum Alphonsum after ch. 130 in Gh that ch. 130 was the last ch. of Rev. IV. This is an addition also found in the Vadstena manu- script K and some other MSS.; see below, p. 106 with footn. 25; cf. p. 108, n. 5o; p. 109, n. 63 f. and n. 66; Kraft 63. 60 See Bergh V 13 ff., 68 ff., 97 ff.; cf. above, p. 2. 61 At the end of ch. 109 the rubricator of K has written Finis vjti libri secundum alphonsum (see below); this indicates that Book VI in the Vadstena Cloister copy of the Alfonso redaction had 109 chs.; cf. Kraft 63. 62 See Bergh 43, 55, 88 f. All the chapters of all the Books were written in full; cf. below, pp. 29 f., 101-104, 148-195. 63 See below, pp. 96-113. 64 See below (K), p. 109, 11. 64. 65 See below (K), p. 108, n. 5o; cf. p. 109, n. 63. 66 See below (K), p. 108. 4-774372 
 
 
 
 
 i 8 hic est finis huius libri secundum alphosom (!).67 In the last-mentioned place, in F, also written in Vadstena,68 and in the printed Latin editions, there is Hic est finis quarti libri secundum alphonsum.69 These notes are important. They show that in Vadstena was known a certain Liber Alphonsi, the contents of which did not coincide with those of K and F. This Liber Alphonsi should reasonably be identical with the cloister's principal copy of the original Alfonso redaction of Birgitta's revelations; i.e. the book which, according to the above-cited information in the letter book of Vadstena Cloister, Alfonso misit pro exemplari et memoriali perpetuo huic loco watzstenensi.70 That Alfonso and his Swedish assistants were very anxious during the canoniza- tion process to supply the Birgittine mother cloister in Vadstena with an especially beautiful copy of the Revelations can be taken for granted. That this was really the case is clear from a letter from Vadstena to its daughter cloister Syon in England. In this letter, which I have already presented above and from which I have cited a passage,71 we are told that ille deuotissimus et egregius heremita magister a 1phonsus remisit nobis regulam ver am in prima persona scriptam iuxta formam sibi diuinitus inspiratam litteris aureis et picturis variis decenter ornatam ad ipsius ordinis complacenciam cum volumine r euelacionum pari modo intus et foris decorato Sicut experiencia docet intueri volenti et hoc pro testimonio fidedigno obserua- mus.72 Thus according to this letter, the original of which was probably written at Vadstena in 1427,73 Alfonso sent the cloister both a copy of RS in prima persona,74 and a volumen Reuelacionum, each decorated outside and inside with letters of gold and paintings in various colours "as experience teaches everyone who wants to see". On the 28th April 1417 some members of a commission collecting material for the possible canonization of the Skara Bishop and author Brynolf Algotsson (f 1317)75 were in Vadstena Cloister. At their request, the then Confessor General 67 See below (K), p. 106. 68 See below, pp. 92-96. 69 See below (K), p. 106, n. 25. 70 See above, p. 12, n. 31. 71 See above, p. 8, n. volenti see H-Sz 88. 72 Cod. Ups. C 74, f. 128 ( 1 33)r, 32-128 (1 33)v, 5. On docet 73 See above, p. 8, n. 74 See above, pp. 2 f., n. 12; p. 8, n. I1. This version of the RS was submitted separately for examination as early as 1377 (see Hojer 65 ff.; Westman 23, 44). As I have mentioned earlier (pp. 2 f., n. 12), the rule in this form was never confirmed by the Pope, but all the same in certain manuscripts it seems to have begun to be incorporated in the corpus Reuelacionum as early as ca. 1390. This can be concluded from its appearance in cod. P (written before 7th Oct. 1391; see below, p. 152), where RS was entered between Rev. VIII and SA, a position it later kept in the printed Latin editions (see above, p. 2). Also in K and A! RS is placed immediately before SA; see pp. II0, 163; cf. L p. 184. In cod. A 20 in the Svenska Riksarkivet (see above, p. 12, n. 3 1) there is a letter from ca. 1430 where reuelaciones vna cum regula Salutaroris in eis contenta are mentioned. This shows that in Vadstena Cloister, where the manuscript was written, RS had by this time been incorporated in the Revelations. 75 Concerning this author see NISLI 2, 144-150; Szoverffy II, 293-297 (with further references). 
 
 
 
 
 19 of the cloister, Ericus Iohannis,76 ordered to be taken out quendam librum celestium diuinitus factarum, in pergameno et reuelacionum beate Birgitte, alias Brigide, littera ytalica conscriptum, quatuor tenacula argentea deaurata et zonis sericeis auro contextis affixa et ad modum manuum formata habentem, a cuius quidem libri vtroque latere super balteo serico ab extra inter solem et lunam deauratos et stellas argenteas hinc inde insertas perpendiculariter, vt prima facie apparuit, continebantur hec verba: liber celestis reuelacionum dei. Cuius eciamprologus in octavo folio a principio numerando sic incipit: Stupor et mirabilia audita sunt in terra nostra etc. Finis autem eiusdem libri in rubro talis est: Explicit vltimus liber Vnde quendam celestium reuelacionum Christi ad sponsam beatam Birgittam alium librum papireum priori libro omnino dissimilem et difformem duo tenacula dumtaxat habentem, qui liber attestacionum beate Birgitte alias Brigide vulgariter nuncupatur, in medium produxerunt ... This account, which is found in Vita S. Brynolphi episc. Scarensis cum processu eius canonizationis (SRS, III: z [1876], 138-185), p. 176, and which has been earlier referred to by Schtick, 'Den nyfunna Birgittahandskriften', 17o f., by Westman 272, n. 3, by Collijn, A &P, III, and by Nordenfalk 385 f., contains, as we have seen, a very detailed description of the appearance of Vadstena Cloister's principal copy of the Revelations, which according to my theory is the volumen Reuelacionum cited in the above letter: It was written on parchment in Italian (Gothic cursive) lettering and had four gilded clasps each in the form of a hand and attached by ribbons of silk and gold; on the outer side of both the front and back covers there was, immediately perceptible, the title of the book, Liber celestis reuelacionum Dei,77 on a silk ribbon placed between a golden sun and moon; beneath these the cover was ornamented with silver stars.78 It is this description of the outer appearance of the book to which the above- mentioned scholars have attached importance. On the other hand they do not seem to have observed that the content is also given: its prologue begins on leaf 8, counted from the beginning of the book, with the words, Stupor et mirabilia audita sunt in terra nostra; the book ends with the following Explicit written in red: Explicit vltimus liber celestium reuelacionum Christi ad sponsam beatam Bir- gittam.79 From this we can only conclude that this principal copy of Liber celestis reuelacionum Dei contained Magister Mathias' prologue and seven books of revelations. In all the Revelation manuscripts known to me, it is only Book 7 76 See above, p. 12, n. 31. Cf. below, the Incipits and Explicits of, for example, codd. B (pp. 1 73-174), 0 (p. 185) and Y (pp- 1 58-159). 78 The sun and moon are probably intended to symbolize Christ (God) and Mary, respectively, whilst the stars may be interpreted as symbols of the angels and saints; see, for example, Rev. I 20: 5; 50: 8; 51: 22; 54: 14 sq.; // 2: 23; IV 7 G; cf. Lexikon der christlichen Ikonographie. Hrsg. von E. Kirschbaum ..., 2, cols. 142-149, s.v. Gestirne; 4, cols. 175-178, s.v.

 20 that is called ultimus liber .80 It is not stated what was entered before Prol. M., which began on fol. 8, in this apparently exquisite copy of the Revelations in Vadstena Cloister. Lists of the rubrics in the succeeding books may have been entered there and perhaps some of the picture varie mentioned in the above-cited (p. 18) letter in cod. Ups. C 74. When the cloister acquired this copy of the Revelations is not known. It was probably sometime between 1377 and 1380. In 1417 it was obviously still at Vadstena. Its later fate is unknown. We can also conclude that the first Alfonso redaction of the Revelations contained seven books, to judge from the following information in Alfonso's Prologue to Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges (i.e. Rev. VIII; see above pp. 2 f., 15; below, pp. sep tem libri continentur.81 22 f.): in illo magna volumine libri celestis See above, p. 16, n. 54. ES 8 A. It is certainly not due to chance that Birgitta's revelations were divided into exactly seven books. The sacred figure seven has, as is well known,—together with the figure three—a special position in the symbolism of figures and probably for that reason would have been considered from the start as an especially suitable number when it came to dividing the Revelations into books; see, for example, Curtius 492 ff.; H. Haag, Bibel-Lexikon, 2. neubearb. u. verm. Aufl., Tubingen, 1968, 1917-1920 (spec. 1919); E. Kirschbaum, Lexikon der christlichen Ikonographie, 4, 154-156; LTK, 10, 1303-1305; Lubac, Exegese, II: 2, zi ff. The conception that certain figures had a symbolic meaning also confronts us in Birgitta's revelations; for example, in Rev. 1 50: 13 omnis misericordia quia innumerabilis et indicibilis est, bene significari potest in centenario numero, in quo notatur perfeccio ... (see the app. sim. ad loc.). In order to make the revelations clear, graphic and easy to understand Birgitta often uses numerals (see, for example, Rev. I 13; 15; 22; IV 102; 125), a schema- tic composition technique which Curtius 492 has termed "Zahlenkomposition". This technique is common in, for example, medieval 'popular' preaching; for example, in that of the French Mendi- cants by whose style of preaching Magister Mathias, Birgitta's father confessor, was strongly influenc- ed (cf. Stromberg 19 ff., 44 f., 87 ff., 175 ff.). It is, therefore, quite possible that Birgitta had learnt this technique from Magister Mathias' preaching. Regarding the use of seven in the Revela- sep tern psalmos ... (cf. tions see, for example, Rev. IV 8o E (ex.) Omni ... sexta feria legas Extray. 9); VI 39 B in quo libro sunt s ep tem libri, et quilibet habet tres columnas ...; 39 K Liber meus est obediencia ... et in hoc sunt sep tern columne ... I should like in this context to draw attention to the fact that, according to Magister Matthias' svenska kungorelse om Birgittas forsta stora uppen- barelse (see above, p. 1o), Christ delivered his first major message to Birgitta in the form of "s e<v en sag* henne fixssin sy[u or bin] ...; see Liedgren I II. When in Epistola words>": Jesus Christus Solitarii (which is divided into seven chapters; see below) Alfonso wishes to show that Birgitta's revelations sint a deo ... et non a spiritu maligno, he does it per sep tern signa seu raciones (ES 6 B [ex]). In making the seventh book the ultimus liber in Birgitta's great work Liber celestis Reuelacio- num Dei he might have had Vulg. gen. 2, 2 f. in his thoughts: Complevitque Deus die septimo opus suum quod fecerat; et requievit die septimo ab universo opere quod patrarat. Et benedixit diei septimo et sanctificavit illum, quia in ipso cessaverat ab omni opere suo, quod creavit Deus ut faceret. The last chapter in the seventh book of the Revelations ends with Birgitta's death, her entry into "the eternal rest". With that her life's work was also completed, her opus, collected into septem libri celestes. When Birgitta was in due course canonized in 1391, it took place—as is well known—on the sev enth of October! My theory that Alfonso's first redaction contained seven books would seem to be contradicted by a piece of information found in the letter book of Vadstena Cloister (cod. A. 20 in the Svenska Riksarkivet, Stockholm). In this manuscript there is a letter (ff. 164Y-165v) addressed to a certain Confrater in christo karissime (by this is probably meant a monk in the Birgittine cloister 80 81 
 
 
 
 
 21 The curious reader will now ask himself the question: Is there any manuscript preserved that has precisely the content and the disposition of contents that to all appearances the first Alfonso redaction had? Of the manuscripts known to me and examined by me, there is none which admits of an unreservedly affirmative answer to this question. However, as far as content is concerned, codd. C and I seem to represent most closely this redaction.82 Most of the other "complete" manuscripts considered to represent the Alfonso redaction of 1377 or 1379 contain, besides Prol. M. and Rev. I—VII, also ES, Rev. VIII, SA and IV 01%83 This is true, for instance, of cod. B which is considered by some scholars to derive from an original representing the redaction of the Revelations presented to the members of the examining commission appointed by Urban VI.84 As I have asserted above (pp. 13 f., 16), there is reason to believe that the two examining commissions under Gregory XI and Urban VI resp. received the same Alfonso redaction; namely, the first Alfonso redaction containing Prol. M. and Rev. I—VII described above. After this redaction, however, other redactions were drafted, containing more revelations. At least one of these redactions would seem Syon in England; cf. below), written in the year 1421, presumably by the then Confessor General of Vadstena, Ericus Iohannis, (on this man see Silfverstolpe 81 f.; above, p. 8, n. 1 1, and p. 12, n. 31). To a question if illud magnum volumen reuelacionum continens viij libros sit a sede apostolica canonizatum, the following answer was given: reuelaciones ille post obitum sanctissime matris nostre beate Birgitte per manus familiarium eiusdem fuerunt gregorio xj presentate qui statim sine dilacione eas examinandas commisit (f. 165r, 21 ff.). The information in the letter that the "large volume of Revelations" handed over to Pope Gregory XI for examination (1377; see above, pp. 13 ff.) contained eight books appears rather perplexing in view of my theory on the content of the first Alfonso redaction discussed above. It is not clear from the letter which eight revelation books are being referred to. In all probability it alludes to Rev. I—VII + Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges, which later began to be called Liber octauus, for example, in K and L. If the figure viij is not an erroneous transcription of vij, this may mean that it was precisely this magnum volumen reuelacionum that contained Rev. I—VIII and that the questioner had in mind in his letter, which was in all probability written in 1421 (the answer to the letter, as mentioned above, was dated this year). The person who answered his letter thought or perhaps, against his better judge- ment, wished to assert that also Rev. VIII was included in the volumen reuelacionum presented to Gregory XI for examination. The conclusion of the letter cited above is of considerable interest. It is plain from this (f. 165', 16 ff.) that it had been stated that beatam Birgittam vnum maximum scripsisse volumen quod in xiiij lib r o s diuiditur. . This statement is commented upon by the writer of the letter in the following words: nachil michi constat. Puto tamen quod aliquas reuelaciones habemus quas vos non habetis vnde si zdtis illas accipere tunc conscribatis principia singularum reuelacionum extra vagancium quas iam habetis et transmittatis ea michi ne contingat mein scribendo supervacue laborare Scriptum Anno domini Mcdxxi. That Birgitta was supposed to have written an extensive volume containing fourteen books of revelations, was completely unknown in Vadstena in 1421. The only manuscript we know of with the same extent is L (see below, pp. 182-185). Thus, this singular redaction, which in all probability was drafted in Syon, existed as early as 1421; cf. below, p. 37. 82 See below, pp. 174-177; 179-181. 88 See above, pp. 15 ff. 84 See above, pp. 14 ff.; below, pp. 171-173. 
 
 
 
 
 22 to have been compiled by Alfonso. It is the redaction existing in the majority of the so-called p manuscripts,85 for example, in B,86 and in some other MSS. I shall call this the second Alfonso redaction. B. The Second Alfonso Redaction As regards the origin and contents of the second Alfonso redaction, I am of the following opinion. In drafting his first redaction of the Revelations Alfonso's principal aim was to include only those revelations which in his opinion would be most advantageous to the Birgittines' endeavour to have Birgitta canon- ized. We can take it for granted that Alfonso was as eager as the Swedish Birgittines to have the first redaction ready as soon as possible. Thus the exam- ination of the contents of each individual revelation could not be as rigorous as he himself would have wished. We should, therefore, not be surprised that the Revelations in Alfonso's first redaction—this also applies to the second—were clearly encumbered by anomalies and inadvertencies of various kinds.87 Quite a number of the considerable revelations that Prior Petrus, at Birgitta's exhortation, had presented to Alfonso for revision and publication88 were found for several reasons, for instance ecclesiastical policy, to be unsuitable for inclusion in the first Alfonso redaction. This was primarily intended for presentation to Pope Gregory XI and the examining commission he appointed. On the other hand, Alfonso realized that many of those not included in the first redaction deserved to be published at a suitable time and for a wider circle. It was important to make Birgitta and her revelations known and appreciated in as wide a circle as possible. Therefore he began to make compilations of certain revelations where the material was arranged according to subject matter. The revelations in Liber celestis dealing with kings and emperors were gathered with others of a similar content into a sort of "Mirror for Kings" which Alfonso called Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges. Of its 58 chapters approximately half are based upon material taken from Rev. II—VII.89 To this book Alfonso wrote an introduction, Epistola solitarii ad reges (ES), which in most manuscripts and in the printed editions is divided into eight chapters. The seven first chapters—ES proper90 —should be considered as a See below, pp. 52 f., 148-165, 170-195, 201. See above, p. 14, n. 38; 15 f., 21: below, pp. 173 f. 87 Cf. Bergh 33 ff., 83 ff., loo ff.; Bergh V 17 ff. 88 See above, pp. Ix if. 89 See Westman 25 f. His information on p. 26, n. 1, needs to be somewhat supplemented and corrected. The texts of the chapters borrowed from Liber celestis were in places subjected to a con- siderable revision when Alfonso used them in his "Mirror for Kings". See Kraft 133 ff.; cf. below, pp. 29 ff. In the printed Latin editions the number of chapters in Rev. VIII is increased by three ( =Extray. 27, 78 and 8o) to 61; cf. above, p. z; Westman 46; below, p. II°, n. 68. 90 See pp. 24 f., 109-III, 120, n. 5; 127, 152, 155, n. 7; 174, 182, 184; 186, n. 7; 189, n. 15; 208. 85 86 
 
 
 
 
 23 defence of Birgitta and the divine origin of her revelations,R whilst ch. 8, according to its rubric, constitutes prologus libri celestis imperatoris ad reges.92 A number of Birgitta's revelations dealt with popes. Most of these revelations were gathered together by Alfonso into a Tractatus de summis pontificibus, a "Mirror for Pontiffs".93 Other revelations concerned the lives of Christ and the Virgin 91 See Colledge 40 ff., 31 ff.; cf. Kraft I13 ff.; Westman 26, 39 ff. In this prologue Alfonso states why he has compiled the "Mirror for Kings" and what princi- ples he has followed: ... Sciendum est, quod iste liber infra scriptus intitulatur celestis imperatoris ad reges 92 . . . At vero quia in ilk magno volumine libri celestis, in quo septem libri continentur, multe reuelaciones ad reges et imperatores pertinentes incluse iacebant et eciam extra illud quamplures eiusdem materie vaga- bantur Et vt omnes eiusdem materie in vno eodemque volumine texerentur, ideo de ilk spacioso viridario predicti libri celestis illas ad hoc pertinentes transsumptiue extraximus et quasi fibres ad fabricandam nouam coronam regalem cum alijs extra vagantibus contexendo in istum librum compilando posuimus ... (ES 8 A); cf. Kraft 133 ff. 93 The tract on the popes is mentioned by Prior Petrus in Dep. cop., 524, 4 ff. (... quarum reue- lacionum multe continentur in libro celesti et multe in libro celesti jmperatoris ad reges et multe in t r a c- tatu de summis pontificibus ...) and was consequently drafted before 3o January 1 3 8o, when Prior Petrus gave his testimony. Moreover, it is cited by Magnus Petri in his above-mentioned (1313. 4, 13 f., n. 32 and 34) letter (... jnspiciatur Liber ad summos pontifices ..., see Undhagen, Une source, 224, § XVII). We do not know for certain which revelations were included in this tract. In Gh and the other printed Latin editions the tract consists of nine revelations; namely, Rev. IV136-144. According to most scholars, this was the content of the tract. However, We s tm an considered that the tract included a further two or four revelations. This opinion is based on the extent of the tract in certain manuscripts (b F L M S s w X and cod. Holm. A 22 [=v in Hollman 56 f.]; see below, pp. 231 f., 92 - 96, 182 - 185, 116 - 118, 222 f., 137 f., 67 f., 64-67), namely the following reve- lations: Rev. VI 63, IV 136, 49, 137-143, (VII 31), (VI 96), 117 144; see Westman 26 f., n. 3; 265-269. In K and Q the tract consists precisely of these thirteen revelations (see below, pp. Io5 f., 121, n. 8). In Fb, the oldest dated Revelation manuscript, in q, and in some other manuscripts the tract com- prises twelve revelations, since Rev. VI 96 is omitted in these (see below, pp. 207, 136). Also in cod. Holm A 22 the tract has practically the same scope as in K, the only difference being that Rev. VII 31 is missing. The twelve revelations of the tract in A 22 are preceded by a common rubric, in which, amongst others, the following details are given: Jste Reuelaciones que sequuntur loquuntur de summis pontificibus quas Alphonsus non omnes inseruit libris reuelacionum propter immin ens scisma Ne secreta diuini consihj et occulte correccionis misteria prodirent in lucem Vnde nonnullis materia scandali occasionaliter potuisset ministrarj ... Thus it was "because of the imminent Schism" (by this is meant the Great Schism which began on 20 Sept. 1378; see p. 25, footn. 105) that Alfonso, according to this rubric, did not include all the revelations about popes when he published the libri reuelacionum; cf. Westman 269, n. 2; below, p. 25, n. Ioi. In the y manuscripts both Rev. VI 96 and VII 31 are missing from the tract on the popes which in these manuscripts consists of eleven revelations. Colledge 33, Redpath 211 f. and S chuck 24 consider that Alfonso's tract on the popes was much more extensive and was identical with the Liber nonus in L; a book which contains 57 chapters, (see below, p. 184). I find it quite impossible to share this view. The remarkable redaction in L, which contains fourteen books, was most probably drafted in Syon and does not seem to have spread outside England. Thus there is nothing to lead us to suppose that Alfonso had anything to do with the extent of the tract in L. Cf. above, p. 21, n. 81; Westman 26 f., n. 3, 38, 44 f., 54; Hollman 55; Kraft 57, 129-13i. Ek w all, finally, concludes that the tractatus de summis pontificibus mentioned by Prior Petrus in Dep. cop. (see above) consisted of the t w enty- on e revelations included in cod. Ashb. 896, Bibl. Laurenziana, Florence (ff. Ir—I 8r), written in 1402 in the monastery of San Girolamo di Quarto sulla Riviera where Alfonso ended his days 
 
 
 
 
 24 Mary. Alfonso also made a compilation of these, the Celeste Viridarium beate Birgitte, divided into three books and dedicated to the nuns of Vadstena.94 In his testimony during Birgitta's canonization process, Alfonso refers to his prologue (ES) to Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges (Rev. VIII).95 From this we can conclude with certainty that both ES and Rev. VIII were drafted before 16 September 13 7 9, when Alfonso gave his testimony.96 Included in this large collection of revelations that Alfonso had been given to revise and publish were also the Sermo Angelicus (SA), the so-called Angelic Discourse, and a number of prayers. The SA, which contains the lessons to be read at Matins by the nuns in the Birgittine cloisters in honour of the Holy Virgin, had been revealed to Birgitta by an angel —hence the name—, probably in 1354.. Also to this work, which Alfonso seems to have valued highly,97 he wrote a pro- logue.98 In his second redaction, which was probably completed around 1380, Alfonso had included—judging by the manuscripts I have examined—ES, Rev. VIII, SA and, probably, four lengthy prayers to Christ and the Virgin Mary respectively, 1389 (see pp.'', n. 28; 156 f.). This collection contains the following revelations: Rev. VI 63, IV 136, 49, 137-143, VII 31, VI 96, IV 144, the so-called Simony Office or Simony Mass (printed in Schmid 203-206 on the basis of cod. Ups. C 86, ff. 146r-147r; translated into Swedish by Schmid 40-43; the Latin text is also to be found printed in Schtick 54-56 and Westman 293-295; cf. Klockars 103 f.), Rev. VI 74, 70, IV 33,10, 5, 57, 78. See Ekwall 37, n. 24; 38, 99. 94 This compilation constitutes the Liber decimus in L; see below, p. 184; Colledge 33 f.; Eklund- Leby 20, 42; Kraft 131-133; Schiick 21, 23, 48-53, 11. 55 (where the beginning of the Celeste Viridarium is found printed); Westman 27 f. 95 A&P, 375, 31 ff. 96 See A&P, 363, 648. Certain facts indicate that these two works had been completed b efore Gregory XI's death on 27 March 13 7 8 (see above, p. 13). According to Magnus Petri's letter, both Gregory and his successor Urban VI had found, after the completion of the examination, that Birgitta's revelations were autentice atque veritate plene et a Dei spiritu veraciter edocte; see Undhagen, Une source, § XVI; cf. §§ VII—IX. According to the above-mentioned letter the favour- able attitude to Birgitta and her revelations taken by Gregory and the examining commission appointed by him should reasonably have been known to Alfonso, himself a member of this commis- sion, before Gregory died. Since in ES he does not in any way mention this examination I find myself justified in suspecting that ES—and hence also Rev. VIII—were drafted before this commission had completed its examination, indeed perhaps even before it was appointed in 1377. If this examination had taken place, Alfonso would hardly have omitted to mention it in ES 6 A—B where he refers to earlier examinations in Sweden and Naples: licet tam clara et notorie manifesta est ista gratia diuina prefate domine diuinitus gratis data, quod nulla suspitione fallacis spiritus valeat obfuscari, maxime cum iam ipso de hoc alias fuerit in regno swecie diligenter examinata per prelatos ac viros spirituales et magistros in theologia ... Et licet eciam it erum in neap oli, in presentia domini Bernardi archiepiscopi et trium magistrorum in theologia et aliorum plurium militum et peri- torum virorum me test e, ista gratia fuerit approbata, ... Nichilominus tamen ... Volo probare ...; cf. above, pp. 20 f., n. 81; Rev.

 25 which are termed the Quatuor Oraciones (IV Or.).99 Thus the contents of the second Alfonso redaction were probably the following: Prol. M., Rev. I—VII ( = the first Alfonso redaction; see above pp. 14-22) + ES, Rev. VIII, SA, IV Or. In my opinion it is this redaction that we find represented in B, Y and other manu- scripts with the same content and arrangement as these two manuscripts.100 Of his own compilations Alfonso only included the Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges preceded by ES. The Tractatus de summis pontificibus and the Celeste Viridarium were omitted, the former probably by way of ecclesiastical precaution.101 There seemed to be no obstacles to Birgitta's canonization after the two papal commissions had completed their examinations of the Revelations and had found these to be autentice atque veritate plene et a Dei spiritu veraciter edocte nec non ad vtilitatem legencium seu audiencium pro saluberrimo fidelium dogmate in sancta Ecclesia Dei in perpetuum cum omni deuocione et reuerencia studiosius obser- uande,102 and after the cross-examination of the witnesses in the canonization process had been concluded and all the documents in the case had been gathered together in 138o into what is known as Liber attestacionum (=A &P).103 Her revelations now aroused greater interest and received greater appreciation. Accord- ing to Magnus Petri it was especially Birgitta's prophetic powers that brought her renown.104 For example, she had foretold the Great Schismlo5 as early as 20 years before it began (20th Sept., 1378).106 According to the same informant, a large number of Royal personages from various parts of Europe now made their way to Rome, others sent envoys, in order to obtain transcriptions of the Revela- tions. According to Magnus Petri this took place whilst he was still in Rome;197 See above, P. 3, n. 14; below, p. 154, n. 5. See below, pp. 1 59 1 73 f., 192 f., 194 f., 201. 101 See above, pp. 23 f., n. 92-93. Of the twelve revelations constituting the Tractatus de summis pontificibus in cod. Holm. A 22 three had already been inserted in the Liber celestis before the begin- ning of the Great Schism on loth Sept. 1378, namely Rev. IV 49, VI 63 and 96; cf. Ekwall 87. If the tract had contained what Ekwall says it did, this would have meant that there were already eight revelations concerning popes in the Liber celestis when Alfonso drafted the Tractatus de summis ponti- ficibus; namely, the following: Rev. IV 5, -10, 33, 57, 7 8, VI 70 , 74 and VII 31; see above, n. 93. 102 Undhagen, Une source, 224, § XVI. 103 See above, pp. 4 f. with footnotes 1-4. 104 Undhagen, Une source, 224 f., §§ XVII-XXI. 105 On the Great Schism see: D. Delaruelle, E.-R. Labande, P. Ourliac, L'Eglise au temps du Grand Schisme et de la crise conciliaire (1378-1449), Paris, 1964; M. Seidlmayer, Die Anfange des grossen abendliindischen Schismas, Munster, 1940; W. Ullman, The Origins of the Great Schism: A Study in XIVth Century Ecclesiastical History, London, 1948; cf. Ekwall 99 fr- 1 °6 Undhagen, Une source, 225, §§ XIX f. Magnus Petri cites as evidence of this some words ex fine decime reuelacionis terczj libri Reuelacionum celestium, found at the end of Add. III 20. The latter shows that the copy of the Revelations cited by Magnus Petri was provided with supplemen- tary material; see above, p. 2, n. 4; below, pp. 28 ff., 105, n. 19; 114, 136, 207. 107 Undhagen, Une source, 225 f., §§ XXI ff.: plures principes et nobiles ... per se Romam venientes 99 100 et ahj suos nuncios mittentes pro libris Reuelacionum habendis, quos, postquam eos instanter petiuerant, in proprzjs suis sumptibus cum exquisita diligencia scribi fecerunt.

 26 i.e. most probably at the latest in 13 8 o when together with Katarina, Prior Petrus and others he left Italy.108 Consequently from the early 1380's onwards there ought to have been quite a number of copies of Birgitta's revelations, as they appear in the Alfonso redactions, to be found around Europe.109 C. Redactions Enlarged by Supplementary Material Due to the Great Schism the question of Birgitta's canonization was not decided during Urban VI's papal period either. After they had deposited the documents from the canonization process (A &P) in Rome,109a Katarina, Magnus Petri imperatorem; frater Petrus de Aragonia Ordinis fratrum minorum, consanguineus regis Francie, secun- dum, quem detulit in Franciam; nuncius regine Castelle de Hispania tercium; nuncius regine Cypri quantum; nuncius regine Cicilie quintum; nuncius Studij Pragensis sextum; frater Petrus de Burgundia Ordinis minorum, theologus maximus, septimum; nuncius Cruciferorum de Prussia octauum; Romani, Ianuenses, Wratislauienses ac plurime alie ciuitates et regnorum nobiles libros istarum sanctissimarum Reuelacionum pro se scribi fecerunt, me adhuc Rome existente. Vnde non exstat dubium, quin plurimi alij ab istis per tocius Cristianitatis diffusam latitudinem iam sint transumpti, pr eterquam in hac terra, vbi adhuc minus condigne supradicte sancte Reuelaciones ab aliquibus ob defectum credulitatis acceptantur ... The important information scribi fecerunt, me adhuc Rome existente has in Turrecremata's Prologue, which is partly based on this letter (see above, pp. 3, 13, n. 32, and pp. 102-104), been condensed to scribi fecerunt Rome; cf. Nordenfalk 38o f. On pp. 116-121, Ekwall has tried to identify the people stated by the letter to have had transcrip- tions of the Revelations made at the time in point. In my opinion certain of her identifications (e.g. episcopus Wormacensis) are, however, erroneous; cf. Bergh 17, n. 6. 108 See flOjer III; cf. below (Ua), pp. 113 f. The pass for Katarina and her fellow-travellers was issued by Urban VI on March isth, 138o, and is found preserved in the Vadstena letter book, cod. A 20 in Svenska Riksarkivet, Stockholm, f. 27r. It is found printed in Ekwall 131 f. If by me adhuc Rome existente Magnus Petri meant a later visit to Rome, which I consider to be less likely, this must apply to his stay in Rome 1382-1383 (1384?). We know for certain that he was in Rome in 1383; see Hojer 12o, 89, III f.; Silfverstolpe 79; cf. below (N), p. 119, n. 2. On the other hand I consider it to be completely out of the question that Magnus Petri refers to his visit in 1390- 1392 (see below, pp. 33-37), during which period Birgitta was canonized. The canonization is not at all mentioned in the letter. Thus the date of canonization, 7th October I 3 91, may be considered as terminus ante quem for the origin of the letter; see Undhagen, Une source, 218; cf. above, p. 14, n. 34. Consequently I have not been able to share Ekwall's scepticism (p. 118) concerning "a general edition of liber celestis 1379, before the canonization". Several of Ekwall's arguments on pp. 115-121 are based on misinterpretations, as I intend to show elsewhere. 109 See Undhagen, Une source, 226, § XXIII (cited above at the end of footnote 107). It is worthy of mention that in Sweden (in hac terra) in the 1380's the Revelations did not seem to have yet met with the attention Magnus Petri thought they deserved; cf. Rev. V 12 C; below, P. 44, n. 42. That it took time for Birgitta "to become a prophet in her native country" can also be inferred from a letter ( =RAP pr, no. 32, dated 15th Jan. <1378>) written by Katarina to Archbishop Birger Gregersson, where she says among other things: "Let it be known to you, dear sir, that Bishop Alfonso has heard from pilgrims from our country that the picture of our holy mother is not found painted in many places in Sweden." This surprised Katarina, since there were many devo- tional pictures of Birgitta in Italy; indeed, even the Pope (i.e. Gregory XI) had a picture of her in his chamber. The letter is found printed in Ekwall 129 f.; cf. ib., 99 (with footn. 4); Nordenfalk 381 with footn. 3o. una See Hojer III (with footn. 2); SRS, III: 2, 261 f. 
 
 
 
 
 27 and Prior Petrus returned to Sweden in March 1380, as mentioned above, and arrived at Vadstena in July of the same year.110 Back home, the Prior had numerous problems to solve. What should he do with those revelation texts which at Birgitta's request he had handed over to Alfonso, but which Alfonso, for various reasons, had considered unsuitable for inclusion in his redactions of the Revelations ?111 What should be done with those revelations which Prior Petrus himself had deposited in Alvastra monastery before Birgitta and her followers had left for Rome in 1349 ?112 Alfonso, the editor-in-chief, had not had recourse to these latter revelations when he began his work of revising the revelations. After the journey home with Birgitta's relics, Prior Petrus returned to Alvastra where he stayed for about a year, 1374-1375. He took charge of the revelations deposited there, and "so that the precious treasure would not be hidden under a bushel and perish" he decided—diuinitus inspiratus—to hand them over to the Brothers in Vadstena.113 However, the presentation does not seem to have taken place immediately, since the Prior seems to have taken with him, when he returned to Italy in 1375, quite a number of these revelation texts. He then used them in his testimony (Dep. cop.) during the canonization process in 1380.114 110 After her return to Vadstena, Katarina wrote a letter to Archbishop Birger Gregersson in Uppsala informing him about what had been accomplished in the matter of canonization. On the content of this letter (=RAP pr, no. 39), which is dated 18th July, 1380, see Undhagen 21 with footn. 3 and p. 120, n. 3; Hojer II 1. m To this category belonged certain revelations in the Tractatus de summis pontificibus ; see above, pp. 23 f., with footn. 93; cf. pp. I I ff., 23, 25. 112 That the Prior had left quite a number of revelations in Alvastra is apparent from the Prologue to Extray. according to cod. Holm. A 22 (cf. pp. 14, n. 40; 23, n. 93; 25, n. 1 oi): frater Petrus prior, reuelacionum conscriptor, quamplures reuelaciones, ante egressum versus Romam beate Birgitte in regno Suecie celitus ostensas, in monasterio suo Aluastro deposuerat, quas nec secum versus Romam apportare decreuerat, que quidem sic relicte ad manus magistri Alphonsi ad libros cum aliis inserende minime peruenerunt (Hollman 114, § 4; cf. id., 40-44, 56). Cf. Bergh i8 f.; Klockars 37; Wessen XVII, n. 1; XXXVIII, n. 1. 112 See the Prologue to Extray., according to cod. Holm. A 22, Hollman 114 f., § 5: domina Birgitta viam vniuerse carnis feliciter Rome iam ingressa, .. . prior Petrus ad monasterium suum Aluastrum, vnde exiuerat, rediens et thesaurum sanctarum reuelacionum tam preciosum depositum ad manus accipiens, ne sub modio tegeretur et periret, diuinitus inspiratus pie decreuit ... ad manus fratrum in monasterio Watzsteno primitiuorum assignare. Concerning the fratres primitiui in Vadstena cf. Nyberg, `Vadstena klosters pionjaree. In this context the reader should perhaps be reminded of Christ's exhortation, found in Rev. VII 31: 6, to Birgitta just before her death: Tu autem dic priori, quod tradat omnia ista verba mea omnium reuelacionum fratribus et episcopo meo ... (see above, pp. Ii ff., with footnotes 29-31). We are given no information as to which brothers the Prior was to present with the revelations. It does not seem unlikely, however, that it is precisely the brothers of Vadstena that are meant in this passage. If it was with this exhortation in mind that Prior Petrus decided to hand over the revelations to the brothers of Vadstena, then the words diuinitus inspiratus in the cited Prologue have a natural explanation. 114 See the Prologue to Extray. according to Gh, Hollman 113 f., § 7: Harum autem reuelacionum veritas ... in attestacionibus domini prioris Petri ... pro canonizacione ... Birgitte factis, pro maiori parte euidenter patebit cuilibet ipsas attestaciones fideliter intuenti. Cf. Bergh 19; Kraft 86, n. 2; Wessen, XVIII, XXXVIII; Westman 16. 
 
 
 
 
 28 It was clearly not until after his return to Sweden in the summer of I 3 8 o that Prior Petrus seriously began to arrange and revise the revelation texts he had at his disposal and which had not yet been incorporated in the corpus Reuelacionum. From the rubric to a collection of texts in the Vadstena manuscript Ua it is clear that in that year the Prior addidit ad fines quorundam capitulorum reuelacionum celestium ista que sequntur .115 The supplements consist of addiciones118 and declara- ciones118 to Rev. I, II, III, IV and V/.117 This collection of supplements ends in the middle of Decl. VI 98. The continuation of the supplementary material is missing, but may have been entered on a number of leaves that have been left out by mistake when the manu- script was bound. The missing supplementary material probably comprised Decl. VI 98 (second half) and 102 plus Add. VII 4,5, ii and 16.118 As is clear from my description of Ua (pp. 113 f.), Rev. IV 131 is included in this manuscript's collection of supplements. It is not known whether Rev. IV 132-144 (these revelations in Gh have the common rubric ... tractatus ... ad sacerdotes [132-135] et ad summos pontifices [136-144]) and Rev. VI 110-122 were also to be found in the, now incomplete, collection of supplements in Ua. Westman (p. 16) has associated the information found in Ua on the date of entry of the supplements, 138o, with—as it appears—information in the Prologues to Extray.118 on Prior Petrus' presentation of certain revelations to the fratres primitiui in Vadstena. On that occasion the Bishop of Linkoping, Nicolaus Hermanni, was present amongst other prominent men.12 0 Westman deduces from this the following: in I 3 8 o Prior Petrus handed over to the Brothers of Vadstena texts which were later entered in Gh partly as declaraciones121 and addiciones121 to the Books already included in the corpus,122 partly as Rev. IV 131-144123 and Rev. V1110— _7-22124 and p a r tl y as a separate book comprising Reuelaciones extrauagantes See below, pp. 113 f. See above, p. 2, /1. 4- ,17 It appears from my account below (p. 114) to which chapters these supplements were added. 118 Cf. above, p. 2; below (F), pp. 93-96; (F"), p. 208; (K) 108 f; Bergh 70-79; Hollman 3o ff. Whether the short supplements to Rev. VIII 16 and /7 found in F and K (see below, p. 110, n. 69) were also included in Ua is more doubtful. 119 See Hollman 113-115; above, p. 27, footnotes 11 2— I 1 4. 120 See Hollman 113, § 2; I 15, § 6. On Nicolaus Hermanni, who was a staunch admirer of Bir- gitta and a prominent author, see for example, T. Lunden, Nikolaus Hermansson biskop av Lin- koping.

 29 (Extray.).125 This opinion is shared by Kraft (p. 72) and, with reservations con- cerning Rev. IV 136-144 (Tractatus de summis pontificibus)126, by Wessen (pp. XVIII ff., XXXVIII ff.), Hollman (pp. z8 ff.) and Bergh (pp. 18 f.). For my part I consider that there are no grounds for concluding from the rubric to the supplements in Ua that in z 3 8 o Prior Petrus handed over the whole of his collection of revelations and other supplements missing from the Alfonso redactions. If anything, the supplements entered in Ua imply that Prior Petrus began his additional work in 13 8 o by adding precisely this kind of supplements, namely addiciones and declaraciones.127 The majority of his supplementary material —which is mentioned in the Cod. A 22 Prologue to Extray.128—was most prob- ably presented to the Brothers in October I 3 8 4 when the cloister at Vadstena was ceremoniously consecrated in the presence of Bishop Nicolaus Hermanni and other dignitaries.129 Thus Prior Petrus' supplementary material was successively incorporated into the Vadstena copies of the Revelations during the 38o's. No Revelation manuscript, however, is preserved containing—as one would have expected—exactly what the Liber Alphonsi contained"0 + the supplementary material under discussion entered suo loco; i.e. a manuscript of the p type +the supplementary material originally included in Ua.131 The manuscripts preserved up to the present day containing such supplements—the so-called a manuscripts132 —represent a text recension completely different from that of the p manuscripts. The revision to which the text has obviously been subjected in the a tradition can in part have taken place when the supplementary material was added to the exemplar from which these a manuscripts derive. After the Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges (= Rev. VIII) had indeed been incorporated in the corpus Reuelacionum and when it had become clear that a number of chapters in this book seemed to be almost identical with certain chapters in the Liber celestis,133 some editor apparently See above, p. 3, n. 16. See above, pp. 23 f., n. 93. 127 See above, p. 2, n. 4. It seems unlikely to me that Prior Petrus would have entered his supplements and explanations into the cloister's beautiful original copy of the Liber Alphonsi (see above, pp. 17 ff.). On the other hand we may assume that by marginal notes in this copy he could have indicated that certain chapters should be enlarged with addiciones or declaraciones. He seems to have collected these either into special booklets or a separate book (as in Ua ), to which he could make references. When later new copies of the Liber Alphonsi were made, these supplements could be easily entered into the places indicated in the copy; cf. below, pp. 96, I13 f., 217, n. 3. 128 Hollman 114 f., §§ 4-6; cf. the Gh Prol., ib., pp. 113 f. 129 See DV (ed. Nygren), p. 10, s. a. 1384: ... Primo introductus fuit conuentus sororum ad tenendum constituciones sancte byrgitte in vastenom presentibus venerabilibus patribus et dominis videlicet henrico archiepiscopo vpsalensi et thordone episcopo strengianensi cum institutore domino nicholao episcopo lincopensi . . .

 3o conceived the idea of revising the text, presumably to save both time and writing materials when new transcripts were made. Instead of writing out the above- mentioned "double chapters" in two places in the same manuscript they were in the future only to be written out in one place, namely in the Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges. In the corresponding place in the Liber celestis133 they con- tented themselves with only writing out the beginning of the respective chapter plus a reference to Libro ad reges.133a However, this procedure had a number of unfortunate consequences: the fact is that the text of the chapters borrowed from the Liber celestis had been extensively revised by Alfonso when he made his compilation.134 Thus in these manuscripts the text handed down in Rev. VIII superseded the text of the corresponding chapters handed down in the Liber celestis.135 Of the preserved manuscripts containing supplementary material only two main types will be mentioned here. These I call the Vadstena redaction and the Prague redaction, respectively, after the places where these redactions first seem to have been drafted. I. The Vadstena redaction The oldest dated manuscript with addiciones and declaraciones added mainly to the same chapters as given in Ua136 and with supplements at the end of Rev. IV and VI,137 is the Krakow manuscript Fb, written in 13 8 6.138 With regard to lua That this principle was not always consistently followed is seen in several manuscripts, for example, F and K; see Kraft 79 ff., 85 ff.; below, pp. 1 °I f., 105—I 1o, 2o6-208. 134 See above, p. 22, n. 89; below (K), p. 1.32, n. ii. 135 See below (K), pp. Ioi ff. 136 See below, p. 1 14. 137 See above, pp. 2, 28 ff.; below, pp. 32, 34. On the contents of what is termed the Tractatus de summis pontificibus see above, pp. 23 f., n. 93. 138 See below, pp. 204-209. Westman 45 contends that it was only through the "official edition" of the Revelations handed over to the Pope before the canonization in 1391 that the relevant supple- mentary material began to find its way into other manuscripts, for example, into M and X (both written in 1 394; see below, pp. 116-118, 64-67). He presupposes that "the canonization edition" of 1391 also contained Prior Petrus' supplementary material (see pp. 28 f., 34-37), an opinion shared amongst others by Wessen XVIII, XXXVII I. The appearance of the supplements in Fb as early as 13 8 6—the existence of this manuscript was unknown to these two scholars (see below p. 35)—makes it necessary to consider other transmission channels for the supplements. In my opinion there is reason to doubt that the "canonization edition" contained any of Prior Petrus' supplements at all (see below, pp. 34-37). Also Kraft (pp. 73 f.) has criticized Westman's theory about the "1391 edition", but his arguments can hardly be given any value as evidence since he maintains, among other things, that cod. X, which contains certain supplements to Rev. III and IV (see Kraft, NTBB,13,156, 16o f.; cf. Westman 266 f.), "derives from a text which has been brought from Italy to Bohemia in the mid-138o's at the latest" (Kraft 73; id., NTBB, 13, 162 f.) and which consequently would have contained the same supplementary material as X. However, Kraft does not give any evidence that this was really the case. The supplementary material in X need not neces- sarily be assumed to have been found in the manuscript that served as the original of the rest of the contents of X. The supplements in X—as those in the other y manuscripts—must reasonably 
 
 
 
 
 31 content and arrangement it agrees almost exactly with q and shows great similari- ties with K (in its unrevised state), M and other a manuscripts.139 I presume that the redaction represented by these manuscripts was drafted in Vadstena. It was later subjected to certain revisions, for example, in K.140 On the basis of particularly the contents of Fb and q141 we can conclude that the Vadstena redaction probably had the following contents: Prol. M., Rev. I-VII, ES, Rev. VIII, SA142 +Add. and Decl., and supplements at the end of Rev. IV and VI agreeing in extent and arrangement with those in these two manuscripts. Probably each book had both text and list rubrics.'" 2. The Prague redaction Among the numerous people who, according to Magnus Petri, came to Rome about 1380 to acquire copies of the Revelations, there was a certain nuncius Studij Pragensis.144 Consequently the University of Prague is likely to have possessed a copy of the Revelations as early as the beginning of the 1380's. At the university at this time there studied and taught a certain Matheus de Cracouia who became magister in artibus (1367) and in theologia (1381). This Matheus, who died Bishop of Worms in 1410,145 was a member of the examining commission have been copied from some 8 manuscript (see below, pp. 32, 52 f., 217) and this, I think, at a time when the Revelation text itself in y had already been subject to considerable revision which removed it further from the r3 tradition. In connection with the inclusion of the supplementary texts in the y tradition it seems as though also the rest of the text in the y and a manuscripts, respectively, had occasionally been subjected to comparison and to mutual changes as a result of this (see below, pp. 56, n. 42; 58, n. 53). The original of the supplementary material in the y hypar- chetype (see below, pp. 53 if., 217) can obviously also be supposed to have been a copy of a libellus containing only Prior Petrus' addiciones and declaraciones etc.; i.e. about the same collection as in Ua (see above, pp. 28 f.; below, pp. 113 f.). This can have been brought to Prague by one of the many Swedish students who made their way to Prague University at the end of the i 3oo's. In the Vadstena diary is mentioned, for example, a dominus Joan karoli as being scolaris pragensis ; see DV (ed. Nygren), 12, s. a. 1387; he died already the next year as diaconus in the cloister.; see DV (ed. Nygren), 13; cf. SRS, I , 102 f., Silfverstolpe, 110, no. 27; Tornqvist, 'Svenska studenter i Prag under medeltiden', KA, 29, 257 ff.; H. Schiick, Ecclesia Lincopensis, 5.31-5o6. In any case the originator of the y hyparchetype was somewhat hesitant as to where and how he should include the supplementary material, judging by its treatment in the preserved manuscripts; see below, pp. 57-85, 217; cf. Kraft, NTBB, 13, 163; Westman 266 f. 189 See below, pp. 104-III, 116-118, 135-137, 206-209. 140 See below, pp. Ioi if.; concerning F see below, pp. 92-96 (with further ref.). 141 See below, pp. 135-137, 206-209. 142 As is seen, the IV Or. are missing in this redaction; cf. pp. 3, 15, 21, 25. 143 See pp. 225 f. 144 See Undhagen, Une source, 225, §§ XXI f.; above, pp. 25 f., n. 1o7; below (X) p. 65, n. 22. 145 See below (X), p. 66, n. 23; cf. Tornqvist, 'Svenska studenter i Prag under medeltiden', KA, 29, 255 f. Ekwall (pp. 116 f.) is almost certainly wrong when maintaining that Matheus de Cracouia is identical with the episcopus Wormacensis mentioned in Turrecremata's Prologue (= Undhagen, Une source, 225, § XXII) and supposed to have had a copy of the Revelations in Rome quem depor- tauit ad imperatorem. By this episcopus Wormacensis is most probably meant Eckhardus de Dersch who became Bishop of Worms 1371 and died in 1405. We know that he was commissioned by 
 
 
 
 
 32 appointed by Urban VI146 and as such would have had at his disposal his own copy of the first Alfonso redaction of the Revelations.147 He himself put forward to Urban VI148 a proposal for the canonization of Birgitta and was in close contact with, among others, Alfonso and the Cardinal of Nocera who were also members of the mentioned commission.146 As a member of Urban's commission Matheus had the opportunity of becoming more closely acquainted with the contents of the Revelations. As a teacher at the University of Prague he may have lectured on them. It may be assumed that during his studies of the Revelations he conceived the idea of revising the text of the Revelations in respect of form, content and disposition. In this way the remark- able Prague redaction may have come into existence.150 Its contents are the follow- ing: Prol. M., Rev. I—II, ES, Rev. VIII, III—IV, SA, Rev. V—VH. What distin- guishes this redaction from the other redactions treated here is above all the placing of ES and Rev. VIII between Rev. II and III and the placing of SA between Rev. IV and V. Further Rev. VII is given a prologue which is missing from almost all other manuscripts outside the y group.151 Decl. and Add. are only found entered after a small number of chapters in Rev. III and IV. Regarding Decl. to Rev. I the reader is referred to in fine sexti (libri) where, however, the promised supplements have not been entered.152 At the end of Rev. IV (after ch. 3o) there follow under the rubric jncipiunt reuelaciones que vise sunt seu facte sunt in monte Gargano de excellencia angelorum sixteen revelations to which corre- spond, in Gh, Rev. IV 131-135, VI 63, IV 136, 49, 137-144.153 As concerns the chapter rubrics it may be mentioned that Rev. /—/// only have list rubrics, ES, Rev. VIII and SA only text rubrics, whilst Rev. IV—VII have both list and text rubrics.154 King Wenceslaus in 1376 to interpose with the Pope to have his election as King of the Romans confirmed; see DHGE, 14, 1381 f.; cf. below (X and x), p. 64, n. 2; p. 65, n. 21; Bergh 17, n. 6. The imperator to whom the Bishop conveyed the Revelations should have been Wenceslaus and not, as Ekwall believes (p. I i6), Emperor Charles of Bohemia. It is stated of Wenceslaus in cod. x that of all books he preferred reading Birgitta's Revelations and the Bible, a fact of which Ekwall is aware (p. 117); see below, p. 64, n. 2. 146 See Undhagen, Une source, 223 f., §§ XIII ff.; above, pp. 13 f., n. 34• 147 See above, pp. 14-22. 148 See Undhagen, Une source, 223, § XV; below (X), p. 66, n. 23. 149 See Undhagen, Une source, 223, §§ XIII ff.; cf.

 33 The disposition of contents characteristic of the Prague redaction manuscripts is regarded by Kraft (pp. 64 ff.) and Ekwall (p. '17) as an "older arrangement", i.e. older than that found in the Alfonso redactions.155 I do not share this view for reasons which must appear obvious by the preceding account. However, this much can be said: an important, perhaps decisive, reason why the creator of the Prague redaction did not place the Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges (= Rev. VIII) and SA after Rev. VII may have been a desire to let the seventh book remain u/timus liber celestis in the corpus Reuelacionum, as to all appearances it originally was; i.e. in the first Alfonso redaction.158 D. The Canonization Redaction In the autumn of 1390 the Confessor General Magnus Petri departed at the head of a delegation from Vadstena for Rome to try and bring about Birgitta's canonization. The prospects seemed good for a successful conclusion of this long drawn-out matter, since in a Bull dated 8 April 1389 Urban VI had declared himself in favour of her canonization and had requested the cloister to send Magnus Petri to the Curia as soon as possible. Further Cardinal Adam Easton of England had promised the cloister his aid in a letter dated Rome 9 February 1390.15 7 When the Swedish mission arrived in Rome at Cristmastide 1390, Urban VI was no longer alive. He had died on 15th October 1389. Also his successor Boniface IX took a constructive attitude, for after Magnus Petri had handed over to him miscellaneous petitions, recommendations and other documents pertinent to the canonization and brought from Sweden, the Pope appointed an examining commission among whose members was the above-mentioned Cardinal Adam Easton. The examination lasted until around Loth August 1391. Following this and in the presence of all the Cardinals, Magnus Petri handed over to the Pope an enormous book with gilt binding and elegantly ornamented. The book contained not only Birgitta's revelations but also the Liber attestacionum (i.e. A &P; see above, pp. 4 f., z6). Since the Cardinals manifested special interest in the Liber attestacionum, Magnus Petri, on the advice of the Pope, had hurriedly caused sixteen beautifully bound transcriptions of this book to be copied (one for each Cardinal).158 By so doing they hoped to make the Cardinals even more favour- ably disposed towards canonization. Thirty scribes were employed for the purpose. See above, pp. 15 ff. See above, pp. 14 ff. 157 See below (Ga), p. 127, n. 7 and 9 (with further ref.). 158 Cod. Ottobonian. Lat. 90 (=R in Collijn's edition ofA CIP) is considered by Collijn to be one of these transcriptions; see Collijn, ASP, p. XVII. The Liber attestacionum also exists in other manuscripts from the same period, e.g. in cod. Holm. A 14, which once belonged to Vadstena Cloister and which may be identical with the librum papireum ..., qui liber attestacionum nuncupa- tur which was in the cloister in 1417; see above, p. 19; below, p. 36 (with footn. 171); Collijn A CIP, pp. III ff. (cod. S). 155 155 5 — 774372 
 
 
 
 
 34 The transcriptions were probably ready well before the canonization on 7th October 1391. 159 The important information about this magnificent copy of the Revelations +the Liber attestacionum presented to Pope Boniface IX in 1391 derives from an eye- witness, a certain Laurencius Romanus (Lars Romare).160 Unfortunately this ingens liber has not been preserved to our days, nor, as far as I am aware, has any copy of it.161 The redaction of the Revelations it represented can suitably be called the canonization redaction. On the content and its arrangement in the canonization redaction, which Westman (p. 45) calls "this edition of 1391", nothing is known for certain. According to Westman (pp. 44 f.) this edition probably had the following contents: Prol. M., Rev. I—VII, ES, Rev. VIII, SA, IV Or. +Prior Petrus' supple- mentary material, i.e. Rev. IV 131-144, VI 110-122, most of the addiciones and declaraciones plus one or two Extray. Westman, who concludes that the canoniza- tion redaction included the Prior's supplements, does so on the grounds that "they were already found in manuscripts in 1394, both from Munich" ( =M; see below, pp. 116-118) "and Prague" ( =X; see below, pp. 64-67), "and this circumstance is most easily explained by their having been already included in the official edition." This view is shared by Wessen (pp. XVIII and XXXVIII), and is cited—without his own position being stated—by Bergh (p. 19). K r a ft is critical (pp. 72 ff. ),162 among other reasons because he thinks that the Prague manuscript (X) cited by Westman is derived from an Italian exemplar written in the mid-138o's which—if I have understood Kraft correctly—must be considered to have contained the same supplements as found in X. As I have maintained See Collijn, A CIP, pp. I ff.; Hojer 112-118. His account of the canonization has been published by K. H. Karlsson, 'Lars Romares Berattelse om den Heliga Birgittas kanonisering', Samlaren, XXII (1901), 1-15; there the eye-witness states the following (p. 3, lines 11-13): ego Laurentius condictus Romanus una cum D. Magno Petri de Suecia personaliter interfui (cf. Silfverstolpe 158). Regarding the presentation of the book to the Pope, he has the following to say (p. 5, lines 8 ff.): Post haec D. Magnus ingentem librum deforis auratum, eleganterque ornatum in praesentia omnium cardinalium pontifici praesentauit, in quo C oe- lestes reuelationes huic S.viduae Birgittae a Deo factaecontinebantur,cui insuper adiunge- batur adhuc alius lib er, qui Latine Lib er a ttestationum dicitur, in quo vita S. Birgittae eiusque prosapia, conuersatio et miracula in vita et post mortem patrata conscripta erant. Hunc cum et cardinales uehementer affectassent, papa eorundem desiderio condescendens a domino Magno expetiit, ut tot exemplaria, quot singulis eorundem D. D. cardinalium sufficere possent, confici curaret, ut exinde omnes ad propositam canonizationem proniores redderet ; quare D. Magnus, ne summi pontificis nutui in minimo deesset, triginta scriptores expeditioris calami conduxit, qui sedecim Libros attestationum descripsere, eosque compactura ita nobili compingi fecerat, ut quilibet eorum uiginti pretio ducatis constiterit. Cf. Collijn, A&P, p. II, where this passage from the account is also found printed; Bueus in AS, Oct., IV (1886), 368 f. 161 We can form some idea of the extent and content of this ingens liber with the help of cod. L which seems to be a further enlarged version of the canonization edition, see below, pp. 182-185; above, p. 21, n. 81. 162 Cf. Kraft, NTBB, 13, 162 f. 159 160 
 
 
 
 
 35 above,163 Kraft gives no evidence that this was really the case. However, we know nowadays that the relevant supplementary material for which Prior Petrus was responsible was certainly found entered in one manuscript (F") as early as 13 8 6, five years before the canonization.164 Consequently, unlike Westman and Wessen, we do not need to assume that this supplementary material was found entered in "the 1391 edition". The supplements can have been handed down through other channels, for example, via manuscripts representing the Vadstena redac- tion.165 With the prospect of having Birgitta canonized in 1391, it was obviously of the utmost importance for Magnus Petri and his Birgittine friends to produce as quickly as possible very impressive, convincing and uncontroversial "evidence" on the basis of which the Pope and the College of Cardinals could make their decision concerning canonization. The Revelations and the Liber attestacionum166 were combined so as to form one large volume, the above-mentioned ingens liber the very size of which was highly impressive. Whether this massive volume origi- nated in Vadstena or Italy is not known. Most probably it was produced in Italy during the first half of i 391 ;167 neither do we know whether it was based on originals brought from Sweden or from manuscripts already found in Italy. As mentioned above, the Liber attestacionum had been deposited in Rome in 1380 when Birgitta's daughter Katarina and her followers returned to Sweden.168 Probably, however, the cloister of Vadstena had also received a copy of this book sometime in the 1380's. As is shown above, the Revelations were to be found at this time in several different redactions. When now, in 1391, they were to be presented to the Pope, Magnus Petri—for both tactical and practical reasons—would most probably have chosen to combine with the Liber attestacionum the collection of revelations already examined and accepted by two papal commissions; i.e. in my opinion the one found in the first Alfonso redaction.169 In a Birgitta Vita which can be assumed to have represented the version included in the above-mentioned Liber attesta- cionumm there are certain references which seem to indicate that Book VII was See p. 3o, n. 138. See below, pp. 204-209; above, pp. 28 ff. 165 See above, pp. 3o f.; below, pp. 217 ff. 1 " See above, pp. 4 f., 26, 33. In this book was included, amongst other works, a Birgitta Vita; see above, pp. 4 f., n. Ia; below, n. 170. 167 Cf. Collijn, A& P, p. III. 168 See above, p. 26. 166 See above, pp. 14 ff. 170 This Vita redaction is to be found in, amongst others, the following manuscripts: cod. G XI 20, Biblioteca Comunale, Siena (=cod. Si in Collijn's ed. of AC 1 P; see ib., pp. XXVIII f., XXXIV, 640 f.), cod. P (see below, pp. 150-152), cod. Lat. 1073, Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal, Paris (ff. it—tor; I intend to discuss this manuscript and its contents in a forthcoming article). It contains certain passages missing from the Process Vita (see above, pp. 4 f., n. la; below, p. 152, n. 1 x). This circum- stance has earlier been noted by Ekwall who, however, does not seem to have known of its presence in the Palermo and Paris manuscripts; see Ekwall 14-16, 7o ff. 168 164 
 
 
 
 
 36 really the last book in the canonization redaction of the Revelations, for example the following: ipse (sc. Prior Petrus) ministrauit eidem domine Brigide sacramenta in die mortis sue, ut supra in ultimo capitulo celesti reuelationum lacius continetur.m By supra etc. is meant the last chapter of Book VII, i.e. Rev.VII3I. Collijn (A &P, pp. III f.) considers it probable that several copies of both the Revelations and the Liber attestacionum were produced in Italy during Magnus Petri's visit there in 1391. In Collijn's opinion the copy of the Revelations which according to the Vita Brynolphi was shown to some delegates to Vadstena Cloister in 1417172 might have been such a transcription. As is apparent from my account above (pp. 14-22), I take a completely different view of the matter. On the other hand Collijn may well be right when he maintains (A &P, III ff.) that the copy of the Liber attestacionum mentioned in Vita Brynolphi is identical with the cod. S used in his edition of A &P.173 This manuscript seems to have been produced in Rome in 1391. S c hii ck and Nor denfa lk both appear to hold the view that the copy of the Revelations that Magnus Petri "presented to the Pope" and "showed to the Roman cardinals" respectively, was precisely the copy of the Revelations men- tioned in the Vita Brynolphi; i.e. Vadstena Cloister's own principal copy of Alfonso's first redaction of the Revelations, the so-called Liber Alphonsi.174 I find it quite impossible to share this view for the following reasons. In the first place the one referred to in Vita Brynolphi to all appearances included only Liber celestis reuelacionum Dei (Prol. M. + Rev. I—V11),1-75 whilst the ingens liber presented to Boniface IX contained both the Revelations and the Liber attestacionum. Secondly, it seems to me very unlikely that Magnus Petri would have deemed it necessary or well-advised to bring with him on the long and by no means safe journey from Vadstena to Romem the cloister's principal copy of the Revela- tions which they had received from Alfonso pro exemplari et memoriali perpetuo.177 171 This passage is missing in the three main manuscripts on which Collijn bases his edition of A&P (i.e. codd. S, R, L; see Collijn, A&P, IV—XXI, XXIX—XXXV), but it is included at the end of the Birgitta Vita found in the above-mentioned (footn. 17o) manuscripts from Siena (f. 2ora; A& P, 641), Palermo (f. 209r) and Paris (f. Ior). It is of course a prerequisite for the above-cited reference to be given any significance as evidence in this connection that it really was to be found in the Birgitta Vita of the above-mentioned ingens liber. This is very difficult to prove conclusively, since the book seems to have been lost. 172 See above, pp. 18 f. 173 See above, p. 33, n. 158. 174 See above, pp. 26-22; Schiick, 'Den nyfunna Birgittahandskriften', p. 270, cites Bueus, AS, Oct., IV, 369 ("volumen geminum Pontifici obtulit, quorum alterum illius [Birgittae] reuela- tiones, alterum vero liber Attestationum nuncupatum, vitam, genus, mores et miracula contine- bat ..."; cf. above, p. 5, n. 4) and explains: "This is the last time we hear of Swedish monks taking this precious book to foreign parts."; Nordenfalk 386: "Probably the same book was shown by the Confessor-general of the Birgittine order, Magnus Petri, to the Roman cardinals at the canoniza- tion of St. Bridget in 1391 ..." 175 See above, pp. 19 f. 173 Cf. Hojer 112, 114. 177 See above, pp. 12, n. 31; 18. 
 
 
 
 
 37 To sum up: it may be said that there are no sufficiently strong reasons to support the current view of the contents of the canonization redaction of the Revelations, or, as Westman and Kraft call it, "the 1391 edition."178 As should be clear from what has been said above, it seems to me much more probable that the canonization redaction, in respect of content, was identical with the first Alfonso redaction. This means, among other things, that it was without addiciones, declara- ciones and other supplementary material.179 E. Other Redactions Besides the redactions discussed above several others were produced and enlarged with Birgittine texts of various kinds, as appears from my account of the manuscripts.180 It is noteworthy, for example, that RS was incorporated into the corpus Reuelacionum in codd. Aa, K and P and that in these manuscripts the Rule was placed before SA, a position it later kept in Gh and the other printed Latin editions.181 In IP 1 and s we find SA, preceded by Archbishop Birger Gregersson's Birgitta Office, placed before Prol. M. at the beginning of the corpus Reuelacio- num.182 In L, as mentioned above, the wide-ranging Birgittine texts have been divided into fourteen books, etc.183 See above, pp. 34 f.

 III. Special Introduction I. BOOK I, MAGISTER MATHIAS' PROLOGUE AND THE EXAMINATION OF THE REVELATIONS CARRIED OUT IN SWEDEN As shown above,' the first Alfonso redaction of the Revelations comprised seven books. Of these Rev. IV, VI and I had the greatest range, consisting as they did of 130, 109 and 6o chapters respectively.2 A very large number of the revelations included in this redaction were revealed to Birgitta during the years 1344-1349 while she was still in Sweden. To this category belong, for instance, all the revelations in Book I. Already in the first Alfonso redaction we find the Prologus magistri Mathie placed immediately before Rev. I, a position it retained in all succeeding Latin editions, the printed as well as the handwritten ones.4 However, opinion is divided as to what was the original function of this prologue. I therefore consider it necessary to discuss this problem together with others connected with it. Let me first point out that Alfonso, the editor-in-chief of the first edition of the Revelations,5 obviously regarded Mathias' Prologue as a prologue to Rev. I alone as well as a prologue to the whole of Liber celestis (i.e. Rev. I—VII).6 The same view of its function is reflected in the Incipits and Explicits to Prol. M., found in the various manuscripts.? Nevertheless it is clear that Mathias himself can hardly have written it with other revelations in mind than those that had 1 See above, pp. 14-22. See above, p. 17. 3 See Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 191 f.; Klockars 35 ff.; Kraft 57 ff.; Westman 23 ff., 14 ff.; cf. Colledge 23, 31 ff.; Schiick 12. On the supplementary material (the declaraciones) in Rev. I see above, pp. 2, 28 ff.; below, pp. 21 7-224. 4 Cf. above, pp. 3, 9 f., 15 ff. In the Old Swedish translation of the Revelations (BU; see above, p. 7, n. io) Prol. M. is missing, as is ES. There is indeed no modern Swedish translation of Mathias' Prologue either. However, the "Prologue revelation" has been translated into Swedish, first by Westman 105 f. and most recently by Lundell, I, 58 f.; cf. Liedgren 102 (with footn. 2). A German translation of the whole Prologue has been done by Ludwig Clarus, Leben and Offen- barungen der heiligen Brigitta, IV (Regensburg, 1856), 345-353. 5 See above, pp. 13 ff. 6 See above, p. 17, n. 57 (with further ref.); cf. Rev. 1 3: 9; VI 75 (in.) Magistro Mathia de Swecia, qui composuit is tius libri pr olo gum, predicante ... By istius libri is meant here not Rev. VI but in all probability the whole of Liber celestis. The cited introductory opening to Rev. VI 75 has most probably been written by Alfonso. ' See the app. crit. of the present edition, pp. 229 and 240; below, pp. 67 f., 104, 126, 134, 148, 158, 173, 184. 2 
 
 
 
 
 39 appeared to Birgitta, and which she had confided to him, before she left Sweden— and consequently Mathias—in 1349.8 According to most scholars Mathias wrote his Prologue for a collection of revelations.9 Schiick has a different opinion. He maintains that it was originally intended as a letter of credence for one single revelation; namely the one found in Prol. M.: 33-40, the so-called Prologue revelation.10 He considers this proved by the fact that in the prologue Mathias himself says, firstly: verba presentis libri, que respectu multorum paucan sunt (Prol. M.: 3o), and secondly: Inicium autem huiusn reuelacion isn facte ad predictam dominam, transmissum12 ad me, qui hunc prologum premisi, ut ceteris illud notum facerem, taliter a Christo assumebatur: "Diabolus tripliciter peccauit" etc. (Prol. M.: 32-33). Schiick omits to translate the two cited passages from the Prologue, but he seems to imply that presentis libri and huius reuelacionis denote the same thing; namely the revelation found in Prol. M.: 33-40, where the verba would be comparatively pauca. One can, of course, agree with Schiick that the number of words in the Prologue revelation is not very great.13 But what did Mathias himself mean by, firstly, verbapresentis libri, que respectu multorum pauca sunt? Westman, who (pp. II f.) has sharply criticized S chii c k ' s opinion concerning the original function of the Prologue, translates these words as follows: "orden i foreliggande bok, som i forhallande till manga (namligen andra bocker) aro f5."; i.e. "the words in the present book, which in comparison with many (i.e. other books) are few". He considers (pp. 9 with footn. 2; 12-15) that presentis libri refers to the first book of the Revelations (Rev. I) and that it was for this very collection of revelations that the Prologue was originally intended.14 It is undeniable that such a conclusion is plausible, since the prologue from the first Alfonso edition's has indeed been placed immediately before Rev. I. Westman further maintains that a number of transcriptions of the Prologue and this collection of revelations was made in view of a forthcoming examination to be carried out by some of the Swedish clergy. According to West- man such transcriptions were sent not only to the examiners, but also to other persons, probably also to the Pope. However, in Westman's opinion these tran- Cf. above, p. 38, n. 3. When revising the Revelations Alfonso himself wrote brief prologues to Rev. V, SA and RS, plus a detailed defence of Birgitta and her revelations, what is known as Epistola Solitarii (ES); see above, pp. a f., 1 7, 22-2 4-- 9 See Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 176, 199-201; Colledge 23 f., 31 ff.; Klockars 35; Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 151-178; Kraft 58 (with footn. 3), 66 f., 115 ff., 185-191; Liedgren 108 f.; Lunden I, 57; NISL, 12, 164; Schmid 135 f., 187; Steffen XIV ff., 304 ff.; Stromberg 19; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 51 f.; Westman 11 ff. 10 See above, p. to; Schiick 11-13.

 40 scriptions were probably relatively few. This would, to a certain extent, explain why there is now no trace of this "edition".16 Westman's argumentation is not conclusive. Objections can, for instance, be raised against his interpretation of the above-cited passages from the Prologue. In the first place it is not absolutely cer- tain that the word liber in verba presentis libri really does denote what we generally mean by book, since in Medieval Latin, as in Classical Latin, it can denote writings of a much smaller extent than normally implied in the modern con- cept "book".17 Therefore we cannot preclude the possibility that Mathias by verba presentis libri did mean the words of the Prologue revelation, as Schiick would have us believe.18 Further, if, as Westman maintains, presens liber refers to the whole of the first book of the Revelations, after Rev. IV and VI the most comprehensive book in the whole corpus Reuelacionum, I have difficulty in finding any reasonable explanation why Mathias should want to denote its verba as "few in comparison to many other books" (respectu multorum pauca). Westman's interpretation shows that he thinks there must be an ellipsis of aliorum librorum after multorum. Whether by this he means "many other books" generally, which I presume, or "many other Revelation books", is, however, not quite clear. Which- ever he means, his interpretation of multorum is, as far as I can see, not correct. After multorum, in my opinion, we should read not aliorum librorum, but ver- borum. Let us now try to find out what Mathias means by verba presentis libri. It seems to me that by presens liber he means neither Rev. I, as Westman maintains, nor only the Prologue revelation, as Schiick appears to believe, but the whole of the Prologue. This interpretation, which no other scholar has previously suggested, may seem rather bold, but appears to me quite natural if the following facts are considered. The Prologue consists of three parts: i. The prologue proper (§§ 1-32). z. The Prologue revelation containing Christ's verba to Birgitta (§§ 33-40). 3. An account of six miracles, opera (§§ 41-46). I maintain that these three parts together form what Mathias calls presens liber, i.e. "the present work".19 When he writes verba presentis libri, que respectu multorum pauca sunt (§ 30) he does not, however, mean the whole content of "the present work" but, as the context seems to show, the words of Christ to Birgitta included in "the present work"; i.e. the words of the Prologue revelation. Thus it is the words in this revelation that "are few compared to the many", i.e. "few compared to the many words"20 16 Westman 9. The examination of the revelations alluded to most probably took place in 1346; see below, pp. 47 f. 17 See Georges II, 636; Blaise; Blatt, NG1, Forcellini, s.v. liber. 18 See above, p. 39. 19 See above, footn. 17. 20 Mathias has shortly before spoken of "the words and deeds that are heard in the course of this `revealing"' (Prol. M.: 24 verbis et operibus, que in apparicione hac audiuntur) and which Birgitta had then proclaimed to others. And, Mathias continues (Prol. M.: 27), tot verba totque miracula non aliam fidem predicant, nisi quam Christus predicauit. Thus it is with regard to these tot verba that verba presentis libri are pauca.—Lunden I, 58 translates multorum by "de manga andra", i.e. "the 
 
 
 
 
 41 that Christ in all had proclaimed to Birgitta from his very first revelation to her21 up to the time when the Prologue was written (ca. 1346).22 As has been pointed out above (p. 39), Schack attaches great importance to the fact that reuelacio is used in the singular in Inicium huius reuelacionis (Prol. M.: 32); to him the meaning of these words seems to have been: "The beginning of this revel at ion", i.e. the revelation included in Prol. M.: 33-40. According to Schack it is this revelation—"the very oldest"23—that the father confessors refer to in the following words: "propter tria cecidit Lucifer" etcetera, vt in reuelacionibus libri celestis plenius continetur. Et hec est prima reuelacio in prologo etcetera.24 There seems no reason to doubt that the father confessors do refer to the Prologue revelation. Somewhat puzzling, however, is their information hec est prima reuelacio in prologo, if by this is meant "this is the first revelation in the Prologue",25 since there is only one revelation in Mathias' Prologue, at least in the version handed down in the manuscripts known to me. One possible solution to the many others". Whether by this he means "the many other books" or "the many other words", is left unstated. Neither is Clarus' translation in this particular place completely clear: "die Worte des gegenwartigen Buches, welche, gegen d a s Vie 1 e gehalten, wenig sind" (Clams, Leben and Offenbarungen der heligen Brirgitta, IV, 35o; see above, p. 38, n. 4). — With multorum pauca Mathias has created an effective but, as we have seen, perhaps not easily interpreted antithesis. He uses this stylistic device quite a number of times in his Prologue; for example, Prol. M.: 8 ... spiritui maligno impiorum spiritui benigno mala Deo et bona diabolo iustorum princeps et rector ... diabolus, fautor et instigator Deus ... Cf. Prol. M.: 21-23, 34. 21 As is well known, Birgitta is supposed to have had visions even as a child, but it was not until after her husband's death in 1344 that she—probably 1345-1346—began to have them in such num- bers. This is apparent from, for instance, Prior Petrus' information in Dep.cop.,484, 12 ff.: audiuit ab ipsa domina Brigida, qualiter anno Domini M° cce° xlvt° (so according to cod. S in Collijn's ed.; R and L have ... x/vP)jncepit Deus infundere et ostendere ei affluenter in magna habundancia visiones et reuelaciones diuinas non sompno sed vigilando in oracionibus anno cf. Dep. cop., 51o, 16 f.: millesimo cccm° quadragesimosexto ...; the Process Vita, A&P, p. 81, anno Domini millesimo iij.0 xl. v.t° (according to codd. S2 and R; L and S' have ... xlvj) facte sunt prime diuine reuelaciones domine Brigide ...; C 15 Vita, f. 74r, lines 12 f.: anno domini m° c° c° xlvj (codd. F and Ga give the year I3440 _Mete sunt primum Reuelaciones domine brigide ...; cf. Ekwall 57 f. with footn. 1z; Kruse 16, § 26; Westman 103 ff., II0 ff.). As mentioned above, p. 8, n. I I , RS had been revealed to Bir- gitta around the year 1345; cf. below, pp. 47-50; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 51 ff.; Lindblom, Vad- stena klosters &len, 23 ff. — In an article entitled 'Arscykeln i Acta et Processus canonizacionis b. Brigide' (Personhistorisk tidskrift, 69 [1973], 1-9) Sara Ekwall has recently discussed the question as to when exactly Ulf Gudmarsson died and consequently also the closely allied date of Birgitta's so-called summoning revelation and the immediately succeeding revelations. Contrary to previous scholars she maintains that Ulf died in 1346. Birgitta would thus have had her summoning revela- tion two years later. I hope to return to this problem some other time. 22 See above, p. io; below, pp. 46-5o. Schiick 12. 24 Schilck 10-12, 35, n. 36-37; cf. A&P, p. 81, lines 9-i t. The version of the Birgitta Vita, quoted here and known as the Process Vita, which Alfonso had helped to draft, can be dated to ca. 1377; see above, p. 5, n. Ia. 25 This is the interpretation given by, for example, Lunden I, 24, and Westman 105; cf. below, footn. 28. 
 
 
 
 
 42 problem is provided by the so-called C 15 Vita from 1373, the oldest version of Vita Birgitte.26 In this Vita the same revelation is referred to in the following words (f. 74r, lines 9 f.): "Propter tria cecidit Lucifer." He c prima r euelacionum est in prologo.27 Thus concerning the revelation in question the following is stated in the C 15 Vita: "This the first of the revelations is to be found in the Prologue." If this information is correct, which, in fact, it seems to be, we have no reason to suppose that Mathias' Prologue originally contained sever al revelations, as would be possible on the basis of the texts of the Process Vita28 and the Pa- Vita (see above, pp. xxxi, 4 f., n. I a). Schiick's interpretation of the words Inicium huius reuelacionis in the Prologue has been criticized by both Westman (pp. I1 f.) and Liedgren (pp. 103 ff.). According to Westman the word reuelacio here does not have the usual Birgittine meaning of revelation,29 vision, but "a more general, a collective meaning = the revelation of Christ to Birgitta which expresses itself by inspired words and accompanying deeds". By this Westman would seem to mean that Inicium huius reuelacionis = "BOrjan av detta uppenbarande", i.e. "The beginning of this `revealingm.30 By inicium reuelacionis Mathias would then simply mean prima See above, 1313 .4 f., n. Ia. Cf. Ekwall 45; Kruse 16; the Pa-Vita (written in 1378; see above, p. xxxi), ACIP, p. 619 a, lines 4-7: "Propter tria cecidit Lucifer", vt in reuelacionum libro lacius continetur. Hec prima est reuelacionum in prologo librorum. 28 See above, p. 41, and footn. 25. Cf. Schmid 187, who says about Mathias' Prologue: "In its preserved state it appears together with a revelation. Originally there were more, but how many and which ones cannot be determined exactly." The view that the Prologue originally contained more revelations, as Schmid explicitly states and which Lunden, Westman and other scholars seem to believe (see above, footn. 25; Sunder' 56), is clearly based on the above-quoted passage in the Process Vita. The discrepancy that appears to exist between information on the one hand in the C is Vita and on the other in the Process Vita and the Pa-Vita is, in my opinion, only apparent. It can easily be eliminated. In my view in prologo etcetera resp. in prologo librorum in the two latter Vita versions can be considered as parenthetical additions. What is said about the Prologue revela- tion in the Vitae would then be: "This is the first revelation (<it is to be found> in the Prologue etcetera)" respectively "This is the first of the revelations (<it is to be found> in the Prologue to the books)". Another possible solution to this problem would be to interpret est (after hec resp. prima) as being incorrectly placed in the Process Vita and the Pa-Vita. The correct position can originally have been before in prologo as in the C x5 Vita. 29 In Prol. M.: 40 (persona, cui hec fiebat reuelacio) reuelacio has, however, rather the usual meaning of a particular, definite revelation, namely, the one in Prol. M.: 33-40; see Westman z i, n. 8. 39 Westman (p. i i) maintains that reuelacio has this same meaning in the first passage where Mathias uses it in the Prologue; namely, in Prol. M.: 4 qui tam dulcibus verbis et operibus quam huius reuelacionis series continet oblatam sibi contempnit et respuit miseracionem. He translates tam ... continet as follows: "sa ljuvliga ord och garningar, som denna uppenbarelses serie innehaller", i.e. "such sweet words and deeds that the series of this revelation contains". I am somewhat doubtful of the interpretation of huius reuelacionis series. It is possible that "the series of this 'revealing"' = "the series of these revelations" (cf. Clarus IV, 346: "Die Reihe dieser Offenbarungen"). I am, however, more inclined to consider that series = textus, tenor, 'text', `contents', a meaning it often has in Medieval Latin texts (see my Glossary). This meaning also appears in the Revelations, for example, SA 20: i (ed. Eklund—Leby): Quoniam ex sacri euangelii (This section serie docetur vnicuique eadem mensura, qua alteri mensus fuerit, esse remeciendum 26 27 
 
 
 
 
 43 reuelacion or prima reuelacionum, expressions which are indeed used for the Prolo- gue revelation in the above-mentioned Birgitta Vitae.32 The correct interpretation of Prol. M.: 32 (Inicium etc.) would thus be the following: "The first revelation that the aforesaid lady received was conveyed to me in order that I, who have furnished it with this prologue, should make it known to others. Christ opened the revelation with the following words."33 In what is termed "the summoning revelation", which Birgitta had received a few days after the death of her husband on z 2th February 1344,34 she was exhorted by God to address herself to Magister Mathias with the following mission: Dic ei ex parte mea, que dico tibi, quia to eris sponsa mea et canale meum, et audies et videbis spiritualia . ..35 Then followed the first major revelation, the Prologue revelation, whose stern message, mentioned above,36 was directed to all sinful "people in the of the text has been completely misunderstood by Lunden IV, 75: "Because we from the Holy Gospel truthfully have learnt ..."; series = textus is missing from Georges and should therefore have been included in the "Index of words", p. 141, in Eklund—Leby's edition of SA). Accordingly in my opinion huius reuelacionis series continet would mean "the text (content) of this 'revealing' ( = of these revelations) contains" or simply "these revelations contain". In this connection it may be mentioned that the passage from the Prologue discussed here is included in a record of miracles dated Vadstena, 2nd May, 2375 (see the app. sim. of my edition. p. 230; Liedgren io6). However, in this place (A&P, 162, line 23) apparicionis occurs instead of reuelacionis. Mathias himself uses apparicio as a synonym of reuelacio four times in the Prologue; namely, Prol. M.: 20, 21, 24. Cf. Westman 2 2 f. For apparicio = reuelacio see MW, I, 776 f., and my Gloss. 31 Liedgren 104 also interprets it in this way. 32 See above, pp. 41 f., and footn. 26. " Westman's translation into Swedish (p. II, n. 5) of Prol. M.: 32 is somewhat unclear and partly incorrect: "Men begynnelsen ph denna till ovannamnda fru skedda uppenbarelse, hvilken ofversants till mig, som fOrutskickat denna prolog for att era den kunnig for andra, mottogs fran Kristus ph foljande satt", i.e. "But the beginning of this revelation appearing to the above- mentioned lady, which was consigned to me, who has premised this Prologue to make it known to others, was received from Christ in the following manner." It is not clear whether "hvilken" (which) and "den" (it) refer to "begynnelsen" (the beginning) or to "uppenbarelse" (revelation). Further it is questionable whether ut ceteris illud notum facerem is governed by hunc prologum premisi, as Westman seems to think. In my opinion the final ut-clause should rather be considered as being subordinate to transmissum, an interpretation which, if Liedgren's supplements are correct, is supported by the corresponding Old Swedish text in Magister Matthias' svenska kungorelse om Birgittas forsta stora uppenbarelse (Liedgren 2 2 2 f.): Jesus Christus . . . sag& ha,nne pxssin sy[u or fiin] ok bolt Jut hon skulde mik Pam [opinbara ok iak] skulde ficom andrum framfara ... (the words within square brackets are missing from the fragment and are Liedgren's own supplements); i.e. "Jesus Christ ... spake these se[ven words] to her and ordered that she should [disclose] them to me [and that I] should communicate them to others ..." Cf. Clarus IV, 351: "Der Anfang dieser, der ge- dachten Frau geschehenen Offenbarung ist mir, der ich diese Vorrede vorausgeschickt, iiberliefert, urn denselben auch Andern kund zu tun." Finally in my opinion a Christo is to be understood as the agent and assumebatur = coeptum est. Inicium assumere may be compared to such pleonasms as initium (principium) incipere (coepisse); cf. H—Sz 793 f. 34 See the app. sim. to Prol. M., 81; above, p. 20. 35 C 15 Vita, f. 74r, lines 7-9; Kruse 16, § 25; Process Vita, A&P, 81, lines 7 f. 86 See p. 2o. 
 
 
 
 
 44 kingdom of Sweden, especially those termed courtiers or knights",37 the social class to which Birgitta herself belonged. Terrified and fearing that it was the devil himself who had spoken to her, Birgitta sought out Mathias, qui expertus est duorum spirituum discrecionem,38 and weeping confided this vision to him under confession. Mathias was apparently very impressed and convinced that it was "the spirit of truth" that had spoken to her.39 In his own name40 he then sent, written in Old Swedish, copies of the message that had been related to him by Enne gufileko mwnniskio ("a godly person")41—he does not mention Birgitta by name. How was this revelation—and Birgitta's other revelations—received in Sweden of the 1340's? What did they think of the rich "lawman's" widow in her new role as Christ's bride and prophetess? No doubt Birgitta learnt soon enough that "no prophet is accepted in his own country"42. It is clear from Mathias' Latin Prologue that, for instance, it was thought that Christ would not reveal himself and talk to "a woman who still lived in this transient world".43 Birgitta's words and deeds were suspected of deriving from "the spirit of untruth", and it was therefore impossible to accept the divine mercy offered through them.44 She was insulted and reviled45 and it was thought that she acted as she did for the sake of personal fame.46 Thus Birgitta and her revelations were received with scepticism, derision and disdain by many; and, naturally enough, especially by those who were most Prol. M.: 35. C 15 Vita, f. 74r, lines 6 f.; Kruse 16, § 25; Pa-Vita 618 b; cf. the Process Vita, A&P, 81; Rev. 1 3: 2, 8. " See Liedgren III (beginning of the Old Swedish fragment); Prol. M.: 6-30. 37 sa 40 In the Latin Prologue Mathias does not mention his own or Birgitta's name. He presents him- self as ego ipse, qui hec scripsi (Prol. M.: 25) and me, qui hunc prologum premisi (§ 32). It seems to be in the rubric to the Prologue found in the ir manuscripts that Mathias is first explicitly stated as being its author; see the app. crit., p. 229; cf. pp. 38, n. 6; 126 f., 184; Decl. 3: 9. For Birgitta, Mathias uses the expressions sponsa Christi (§ 14), femine (§ i8), predictam dominam (§ 32), persona, cui hec fiebat reuelacio (§ 4o), una ignara mulier (§ 41), hec mulier (§ 43) and dicte domine (§ 45). 41 Liedgren iii; above, P. 43, n. 31 and 33; cf. Klockars, NISL, I2, 174 ff.; Sunden 52 ff. 42 Luke 4, 24 nemo propheta acceptus est in patria sua. That the soil of Sweden was not parti- cularly fertile or suitable for the message Birgitta sowed, is apparent from a number of the revela- commixtum est. Ideo verba tions; e.g. Rev. V 12: II (ed. Bergh) Regnum istud cum peccato magno mea adhuc hic ascendere et fructificare non possunt ... 14 ... prius alibi ascendent et proficient, donec duricia terre istius regni ... aperiatur. Birgitta received this revelation before she left Sweden in 1349. In the 1380's the climate in our land was still rather unfavourable to the revelations. In a letter from that period Magnus Petri, Confessor General of Vadstena, expresses his disappointment over this in the following words: in hac terra ... minus condigne supradicte sancte Reuelaciones ab aliquibus ob defectum credulitatis acceptantur et iuxta suarum spiritualium consolacionum decenciam non adeo venerabiliter, ut merito congrueret, amplectuntur. Quod quidem videtur quasi contra naturam fieri, cum ex earum fontali origine teneremur eas affectancius concupiscere, desiderancius assumere et ... pro nostris viribus efficacius honorare (Undhagen, Une source, p. 226, §§ XXIII f.).

 45 criticized in the revelations: knights and courtiers, kings, princes, and priests.47 The monks of Alvastra, where Birgitta resided for a few years after her husband's death,48 were also doubtful. One considered her non habere cerebrum sanum sed esse fantasticam.49 At first Prior Petrus thought a maligno spiritu hec verba procedere.50 When the doubts about the authenticity of the revelations and Birgitta's divine calling became too threatening Mathias obviously felt himself bound to intervene in defence of Birgitta and therefore wrote his Prologue. I shall not give a detailed analysis of its content but only draw attention to what appears to me particularly important. The very introductory words of the Prologue, Stupor et mirabilia audita sunt in terra nostra,51 reveal that Mathias was struck with amazement by the wonder that had been apprehended "in our country" (= Sweden). He considers Christ's revelation (apparicio) to Birgitta as more amazing than the incarnation itself,52 so marvellous that it is hardly possible to believe it and with man's meagre under- standing to comprehend this great wonder in its full magnitude.53 Although Mathias himself had been completely convinced by Birgitta's words and deeds that it was the "spirit of truth" that spoke to her, he had difficulty in really compre- hending it. Despite this he considered that it was of the greatest importance that their truth should be completely accepted. However, he did not expect everyone hearing of this wonder to believe it immediately. For neither had Christ's contempories been able to believe when they heard of his resurrection and only later became convinced of it.54 Only those who, like Mathias, themselves had received grace from the same spirit as Birgitta would be able to believe that Christ revealed himself and spoke to her.55 The fact that all Birgitta's words and wonders preached the same belief as Christ had done ought, says Mathias, to make it easier for everyone to accept them as true and authentic.56 Mathias contin- ues, the truth found in Christ is neither diminished nor exaggerated in them but through these words and deeds his mercy appears all the more abundant as the sinners' misery was then greater than ever before.57 It is precisely this preaching in the revelations of the mercy, the clemency and the love of God that Mathias Prol.

 46 wishes to stress in the Prologue.58 The stern judgement with which, according to the Prologue revelation, God was to have struck sinful people of Sweden long ago, had not yet been effected as He had been moved to pity by Birgitta's and others' prayers.59 In order to show that Birgitta's words and deeds were inspired by spiritus fallacis spiritus mentibus ista legencium veritatis and so that no suspicio obrepat (§ 6), Mathias adduces several pieces of "evidence" (§§ 6-31, 41-46) of— to say the least—varying value. He says, for instance, "one cannot believe that the evil spirit can deceive truly righteous people"—such as Birgitta—"or convert sinners to a better way of life" (§ 6), as Birgitta had done. "A truly righteous person does not strive for personal honour" Mathias continues (§ i o). All her life Birgitta had thought "not of her own honour but that of God" and "she would rather have lived unnoticed in order to preserve her humility if she had not been given by the spirit, or rather by Christ manifesting Himself to her through the spirit, the task of bringing herself to the notice of certain people in order to save her fellowmen" (§ 16). Everyone desirous of examining Birgitta's deeds more closely could, if he so wished, find reliable witnesses with whose help he could confirm the validity of the deeds (§ 30. After citing the Prologue revelation as an example showing that the words of the revelations are full of "the power of truth", and therefore can only have come from "the spirit of truth", Mathias ends his prologue by quoting six deeds as evidence of the truth of what he had related about Birgitta and her revela- tions.80 As the sixth and last piece of evidence he mentions "the conversions of several great men of the realm who at a suitable time and at a suitable place will unanimously a vow that they had experienced a change for the better in their hearts ... because of her words ..." (§ 46). The concluding word, fatebuntur,61- of the Prologue indicates that Mathias wrote it at a time when he expected that there would be a meeting to examine and decide upon Birgitta's revelations. Can this date be more exactly determined? From information in the Prologue itself we can establish with certainty that it was written after Birgitta had been widowed62 and chosen as Christ's bride,83 and after she had received a considerable number of revelations and worked many miracles.64 Probably it was drafted after the Old Swedish version of the Prologue Prol. M.: 2-6, 20, 23, 29. Prol. M.: 38-40. 89 Mathias' account of the deeds nos. 2-6 (Prol. M.: 42-46) have been included, almost completely unchanged, in the Process Vita (pp. 90, 17-91, 7) by Bishop Alfonso and are found again in the Pa-Vita (pp. 624 b-625 a); cf. Ekwall 40 f.; Liedgren 106 f.; above, pp. 4 f., n. 1 a. Schtick's opinion (p. 36, n. 39) that these six opera in Prol. M.: 41-46 "are almost certainly to be considered as a d eclaratio inserted by Prior Petrus", is, as Westman (p. 12, n. 2) has shown, completely unaccept- able. 81 Some manuscripts have fatebantur, a reading which I consider incorrect; see the app. crit. to Prol.

 47 revelation had been published and many other of her revelations had become known in Sweden. As terminus ante quem I would give I May 13 46 when King Magnus Eriksson and Queen Blanche donated in their will Vadstena Crown demesne for a future convent in Vadstena.65 I maintain that it was only after Mathias (through his Prologue and in other ways)66 and other authorities had convinced the royal couple that the Birgittine revelations were authentic that the magnificent will was drawn up.67 Before this took place it is probable that Birgitta's Order rule, Regula Salvatoris, had been drafted and subjected to the examination mentioned in its prohemium, most probably written by Alfonso,68 in the following words:... multa audiuit (sc.

Thus at a point when Birgitta herself—like many others—still doubted the divine origin of the revelations, according to the above-mentioned prohemium, she had them presented for examination to "the Archbishop of Uppsala plus three other bishops and a certain most pious magister who was considered a great theologian, plus a devoted and godly abbot". The result of this examination is given as "all these and numerous friends of God" affirm that all the examined revelations proceeded from "the good spirit of truth and light". Where and when the examination took place we do not know with any certainty. Most probably it was carried out in Uppsala to which city, sometime in the spring of 1346, Hemming Nilsson, Archbishop 1342-1351,69 may have called the three 65 DS, V, pp. 561-568; cf. Hojer 54 ff.; Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 170 ff.; Kraft 189-191; Liedgren 102 ff., io8 f.; Lindblom, Vadstena klosters &len, 24-29; Steffen XIV ff., 304 if.; Sunden 16, 66 ff.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 51 ff., 119 ff.; Westman 11 ff., 113 ff. 66 Mathias seems to have been on good terms with King Magnus; see Stromberg 27; cf. Sunden 73 ff., 114-133. 67 Lindblom, Vadstena klosters &len, 27, and Steffen XIV are of the same opinion. Cf. Sunden 66-75. This scholar considers (p. 68) that Mathias wrote his Prologue only "after the drafting of the Order rule and after the King and Queen had drawn up their will". 68 See above, pp. 2 f., n. 12; pp. 12, n. 31; 18, n. 74; cf. Rev. 1 52: 8; IV 78 A; ES 3 A—B, 6 A—B; Extray. 51; above, p. 24, n. 96; Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 168 ff.; Kraft 115, n. 2; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 49 ff.; Westman 13 (with footnote 3), 24 f. 69 Hemming Nilsson had received his higher academic education in Paris, where he became, in 1333 at the latest, Magister of Theology. Among his fellow students there seem to have been three future bishops who are of special interest here: Hemming, Bishbp of Abo 1338-1366, Thomas Johansson, Bishop of Vaxjo 1344-1376, and Petrus Tyrgilsson, Bishop of Linkoping 1342-1351, Archbishop of Uppsala 1351-1366. Hemming Nilsson seems to have collaborated well with King Magnus Eriksson and at one point was a member of the King's government; see Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 85-90, 95, 97, 100, 104-106, 176, 198, 599, 613, 616, 658; G.

 48 bishops mentioned above,70 the most pious magister, the godly abbot and the many friends of God to discuss in detail Birgitta's "verba et opera". Presumably on this occasion "the reliable witnesses" mentioned by Mathias in his Prologue (§§ 31, 43, 44) were present.71 Amongst these were almost certainly at least some of the many great men who had been converted and whom Mathias seems to have counted as witnesses.72 Who were the three bishops, the magister and the abbot that participated in the examination conducted by the Archbishop? That the magister was Mathias and that one of the bishops was Hemming of Abo,73 one of Birgitta's most faithful friends, there seems no reason to doubt.74 The abbot is presumed by most scholars to have been Prior Petrus and this seems reasonable to me.75 No one seems to have attempted to identify the other two bishops. In my opinion they may well have been, as I shall show, Bishop Thomas of Vaxjo and Bishop Petrus Tyrgilsson of Linkoping.76 As the number of revelations increased and their message began to affect more people and abuses both within and without of Sweden, for example, "the Babylonian Captivity" of the popes and "the Hundred Years War" between England and France, obviously the need to have their divine origin established increased. When this had taken place Birgitta could act with greater authority and confidence, and count on there being greater respect not only for their message but also for her own person. In Rev. I 52: 1-8 the Virgin Mary prays that God will grant that his words, i.e. Birgitta's revelations, shall take root in His friends' hearts, and extending their branches throughout the world, shall blossom and bear goodly fruits. God promises that this shall come to pass and He then gives the following commission to Bir- gitta: "Say to your friend that he shall meticulously lay forth in writing these words stiffs herdaminne, I, 418-420; Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 45, 142, 153, 197 ff.; Asbrink—Westman, Svea rikes arkebiskopar frdn 1164 till nuvarande tid, lo5-111. 70 It is in all probability precisely this "meeting of bishops" that is referred to in Extray. 51, where Christ says to Birgitta (§ 2): Nunc igitur conuentis episcopis dic archiepiscopo: `Miraris, quare loquor verba mea ...' Cf. Sunden 61 ff.; Westman 12 ff. 71 According to Prior Petrus, two of the witnesses cited in the Prologue were Magister Mathias himself and Bishop Thomas of Vaxj8; see the app. sim. to Prol. M., 200 and 203. That these are identical with "the most pious magister" resp. one of the three bishops participating in the examina- tion of the revelations I entertain no doubt. 72 Prol. M.: 46; see above, p. 46. 73 For more about this bishop see Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 82-93; 151 ff.; passim. 74 See, for example, Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 50, n. 8; Westman 13. 75 See Lindblom, Vadstena klosters &len, 25; Steffen XIV; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 50, n. 5. Westman 13, n. 3, refutes the idea of Prior Petrus with the following argument: "if he had sat on such a commission he would surely have had something to say about it", namely, in the Process Vita and in the Dep. cop., "but in the former, the examination is not mentioned at all, in the latter only generally" (see Dep. cop., 485, 16 ff.). Hojer 34 presumes that the abbot was Svennung of Warnhem; see above, pp. 8 f., n. 13. 76 See above, pp. 47 f., n. 69; below, pp. 49 f., 147. 
 
 
 
 
 49 before his spiritual father, ... , and he will convey them to the Archbishop and thereafter to another bishop. When these persons have been thoroughly acqu- ainted with them he shall send them to a third bishop."77 The concrete content of this passage would seem to be this: Birgitta exhorts her friend Magister Mathias to carefully expound hec verba conscripta—this would seem not only to refer to Rev. 1 52 but also to other revelations—to the Bishop of Linkoping, Petrus Tyrgils- son,78 who79 will then contact Archbishop Hemming Nilsson in Uppsala and Bishop Thomas in Vaxjo,80 and let them become acquainted with the revelation(s) in question, which shall then be sent to Bishop Hemming of Abo. As we have learnt above, Mathias was once commissioned by Birgitta to publish her first major revelation, the Prologue revelation.81 Now the point was to publish and convey certain revelations to the Pope, a task that Bishop Hemming of Abo was entrusted with.82 Before this took place Birgitta obviously considered it necessary 77 Rev. I 52: 8. Concerning the Latin text of this passage established by me, which in one parti- cular respect deviates from earlier versions, see below, pp. 146 f. 78 See above, pp. 47 f., n. 69. That Birgitta urged Mathias to turn to the head of his own diocese, Petrus Tyrgilsson, appears quite natural to me in view of several facts. Petrus was bishop of the diocese to which Vadstena belonged and where Birgitta wished to found her monastery. Mathias knew the bishop well and seems to have enjoyed his high opinion; for on the 26th February, 1 343, Bishop Petrus had secured from Pope Clement VI in Avignon the appointment of Mathias to the benefice of St. Ilian (Egidii), the parish church of Soderkoping (east of Linkoping); see Carlsson, 'Master Matthias', 2 ff.; Liedgren 107; cf. Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 82, 94, 104, io6--Io8, 116 f., 183, 196; Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 83, 201 ff. Of the Swedish bishops, the Bishop of Linkoping was traditionally considered to be next in rank to the Archbishop. Con- sequently everything points to it being Petrus Tyrgilsson, Bishop of Linkoping, who was entrusted with the task of contacting and forwarding Birgitta's verba conscripta to the Archbishop. 78 On the basis of the Latin text in all the earlier editions most scholars have up to now thought that it was Mathias himself who was to address the Archbishop with Birgitta's message; see below, PP. 146 f.; Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 197 f., for some reason states that it was Bishop Hemming of Abo who "presented the earlier revelations to ... the Archbishop of Uppsala". Cf. Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 153, n. 5. 80 Together with Magister Mathias, Bishop Thomas, fellow student and close friend of Arch- bishop Hemming and the two discussed bishops (see above, pp. 47 f., n. 69), had been present at two exorcisms that Prior Petrus had carried out at Birgitta's command; see above, p. 48, n. 71; Brilioth, Svenska kyrkans historia, II, 100, 109, 207; Klockars, Bishop Hemming, 45, 83, 98, 196 f., 201 ff. 81 See above, p. IO. 82 As Steffen XIV f. has pointed out, it seems likely that also Mathias' Prologue was taken to Pope Clement VI, one of the reasons being that the revelation directed at Clement VI, Rev. VI 63 (see below) contains a passage (Si autem dubitas, cuius spiritus verba ista sint, ecce regnum et persona nota sunt, in quibus stupor et mirabilia facta sunt) which seems to allude to the introductory words of the Prologue, Stupor et mirabilia audita sunt in terra nostra, and imply that the Pope was already acquainted via the Prologue with Birgitta and the marvels that had occurred in Sweden. Cf. Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 175, 156 ff.; Kraft 185-191; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 52; Westman 13 f. Thus Mathias' Prologue may be assumed as having acted as an introduction to and a re- commendation for the collection of revelations that Bishop Hemming and Prior Petrus took to the Pope (see below). As a further "testimony" they would probably have had with them some report issued by the examining commission on the divine origin of the revelations and Birgitta's credibility. Such a testimony and Mathias' Prologue may have been what Birgitta primarily had in mind when 6 — 774372 
 
 
 
 
 50 that the revelations be subjected to an expert examination by the above-mentioned persons. To ascertain exactly which revelations were examined by the Swedish arch- bishop and his assistants is rather difficult.83 They would most probably have been primarily the revelations referred to by hec verba conscripta in Rev. I 52: 8 and those referred to by God as verba mea, que proprio ore locutus sum in Rev. I 52: I I. To this latter category most probably belonged Rev. VI 63 and IV 103-105 (directed at Pope Clement VI and the kings of England and France respectively) which Bishop Hemming and Prior Petrus took with them to France, probably. 1346-1347.84 Amongst the revelations presented to the Swedish examining com- mission was obviously also an early version of the Order rule, Regula Salvatoris,85 in whose Prohemium the examination is mentioned, Extray. 51,8 6 and presumably also other early Birgitta revelations, among these being those in Rev. 1.8 7 2. THE MANUSCRIPTS AND THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIPS In this chapter I shall present and try to classify the 69 manuscripts I have examined in order to compile the first modern and critical edition of Rev. I and Prol. M. The descriptions of the contents, appearance, provenance etc. of the manuscripts are relatively detailed; this has been done in order to simplify for other scholars the remaining task of editing St. Birgitta's Revelations. The classifi- cation of the manuscripts is based on my own collations of their respective texts of Rev. I and Prol. M. The text edited by me was complete and in galley proof in 1968. Nine of the sixty-nine manuscripts now examined came to my notice after this date, i.e. when the text was already established; namely, Ab Bb Cb Db Eb r Fb Gb Hb and Kb. In order to ascertain any possible value these manuscripts might have for the restitution of the original text, I made random collations from them. The time-consuming examination of these recently found manuscripts happily presented me with no grounds for changing the established text. But this does not mean that the labour was completely fruitless. Especially profitable was the study of Fb, the oldest dated Revelation manuscript. For thanks to this MS. some important conclusions could be drawn, for instance, concerning the Bishop Hemming was given the following exhortation in Rev. I 52: 12 ad maiorem euidenciam ver- borum meorum eorum testimonia tecum ad pontificem deferes, quibus verba mea sapiunt et delectant. 83 As stated above (p. 39), Westman is of the opinion that it was probably the whole of the present Rev. I. 84 For more details see Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 553 ff.; Kraft 185 ff.; Liedgren, 'TN/ Bir- gittinska data', PT, 70, pp. 52-54; Sunden 68 ff. 85 See above, pp. 2 f., n. 52. It is probable, but by no means certain, that RS was also taken to the Pope for approbation; see Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 168 ff.; Kraft 58, 185-191; Lindblom, Vadstena klosters aden, 3o ff.; Steffen XIV ff.; Sunden 68; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 51 ff. 86 See above, p. 48, n. 70 87 See above, p. 38. 
 
 
 
 
 51 history of the corpus Reuelacionum.1 Ab proved to be a better representative of what is termed the p, tradition than cod. m used in my edition.2 In Cts and Db an acrostic poem in honour of St. Birgitta was found; I had shortly before edited this on the basis of other manuscripts, etc.' Rev.

In their present condition some of these are defective and lack certain sections of the text; others contain only a selection of revelations from Rev. I. These incomplete manuscripts are: 13 Z4 Day Fa6 Hal Db8 Eb9 Kb9a flO j11 q12 v.13 To these is to be added one other manuscript, Ua, which of Rev. I only contains the declaraciones.14 Prol.

A first, provisional, division of 12 Revelation manuscripts into 3 groups, based on their contents, was done as early as 1911 by Westman 263-270. A smaller number of the manuscripts given here also contain Extravagantes—the most important are F K L R S t— and have been classified on the basis of this text by Hollman 46 ff. 
 
 
 
 
 52 his work on this he examined a further 9 of the manuscripts dealt with here.21 The following year, 1972, a modern edition of yet another Birgitta work, SA, was published, prepared by Dr. Sten Eklund, partly on the basis of a typewritten dis- sertation for the Swedish Licentiate degree presented by Mr. Henrik Leby. In this work, henceforth called Eklund—Leby,22 37 of the above-listed manuscripts were classified on the basis of their SA text. Of the manuscripts presented here the following 20 have not previously been classified: A D Ba Da Fa Ga Ha ja Ka La Sa Ta Ua Bb Cb Gb Hb Kb Mb a. As is apparent from the above, the majority of the manuscripts examined contain, besides Rev. I and Prol. M., also Rev. V and Rev. VII plus SA. The results arrived at in Bergh's doctor's thesis concerning the mutual relationships of the examined manuscripts—described in detailed stemmata—and their value for establishing the text of Rev. VII, was later to a great extent verified by the examination of the text of Rev. V in the most important of the mentioned manu- scripts. By partial collation of the latter text in a further thirteen manuscripts Bergh could fit these, too, into his stemma codicum. 23 Eklund—Leby's collations of the SA text in most of those MSS. led, in the main, to the same conclusions and stemma codicum.24 Neither has my collation of the text of Rev. I and Prol. M. given reasons for any essential revision of Bergh's original stemma. However, certain corrections and supplements must be made, partly because the texts examined by me are found in manuscripts where Rev. V and VII are lacking, and which Bergh consequently had no reason to take into consideration in his study of the relationship between the manuscripts. In the following presentation the 9 newly discovered Rev. I MSS. will be treated separately at the end (pp. zoo-216). A special section will be devoted to the classification of manuscripts containing supplementary material, the so-called declaraciones, added to Rev. I (pp. 217-224). P --7n The Rev. I manuscripts can be divided into two classes, p and r. This division is based on the following two facts. Firstly, the p MSS. lack supplementary material to Book 1,25 which has precisely the coverage characteristic of the Alfonso redactions and, in my opinion, of the so-called canonization redaction.26 On the other hand the 7c MSS. have all or most of these supplements either entered See Bergh V, pp. 34-66 (esp. 59 ff.). See above, p. xvi. 22 See above, footn. 21 . 24 See Eklund—Leby 22, 25-74- " The supplementary material in Rev. I consists of 7 declaraciones, attached to chs. 3, 13, 16, 2 7, 23, 28, 32. See pp. 2, 28 ff., 217-224. Via a secondary influence from some source outside f some of this material has been incorporated in cod. L, which is a (3 manuscript; namely, Decl. 13, 16, 28 and 32; cf. Bergh 42, 70-79; see below, pp. 184 with footn. 9; 218. 21 22 26 See above, pp. 14-26, 33-37. 
 
 
 
 
 53 suo loco,27 or they were planned to be entered at the end of Rev. VI.28 Secondly— as we shall soon see—in a number of places in the text, both in Rev. I and in Prol. M., p and n show divergent readings of such a nature that it can be assumed that the two classes of manuscripts reflect their respective hyparchetype, p and Tr; they consist of the following manuscripts: p: ABCEHIJLOPRVYAa Fa Oa Sa acdemo (23).29 p Ea Ga Ha ja Ka La pa Ta tja30 Mb b n: DFKMNQSTWXZBa a lqstvwxyz f g hi (37).31 Without expressing an opinion as to which reading is to be considered the original and correct, the secondary and incorrect one, I shall illustrate the division of the traditions of the manuscripts in the above-mentioned classes or branches with the help of the following p resp. 7t readings:32 37, 9 inueniri (-re Racl) 3: reperiri (-re 1 s1 deest Gra Ha f j q) 7r Gh; 47, 72 admouetur (ammo- m) p exc.

M., 144 et fideliter (deest I) p: fideliterque (et fideliterque X w deest Z Ha Mb f) TC Gh. shall now proceed to a closer examination of the relationship between the manuscripts within each respective class beginning with the TC MSS., the larger of the two. I The a MSS. The it MSS. divide into two main groups, y and 8, consisting of the following manuscripts: 1: T X Z Ea Ka La fjtvwxyz (4); a: DFKMNQSWBa Da Ga Ha ja Pa Ta Ua33 Mb bghlqs (23). 27 This is the case in two groups of it MSS., which I shall call 8 and y2; see below, pp. 57-63, 85-147, 202-224. 28 This is the case in the so-called yi MSS. which at the end of the chapters in question contain references of the type Declaracionem require in fine sexti libri; the revisor's plan to enter these decla- raciones in the indicated places has, however, never been realized in the yi MSS. See below, pp. 63-85, 217. Respecting y2, see below, pp. 57-63, 217-224. 29 To this class also belongs the newly discovered Ab manuscript; see below, pp. zoo f., 211. 30 This manuscript lacks Prol. M. and contains, as mentioned above, only the declaraciones to Rev. I; see above, p. 51, below, pp. 113 f. 31 To these should be added, as I shall show on pp. 211-216, 8 of the 9 newly discovered manu- scripts; namely, Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Hb and Kb. 32 For further examples, see the app. crit. to Prol. M., 103, 155, 163, 209; Rev. 1, 47; 6, 25; 32, 27; 38, 55; 41, 81; 42, io; 43, 39; 44, 12; 45, 19; 47: R; 48, 17; 50, 2 ; 53, 1 7; 59, 16; etc. For the edition of the Latin text I have naturally not used all the 1 and it MSS., but only a representative selection. In the critical apparatus (3 denotes the consensus of B m 0 0a P V Y and it the consensus of F K q x y; see pp. 225, 228. 83 See above, pp. 28f., 31, n. 138; 51. 
 
 
 
 
 54 1. The y group Among the r MSS., y forms the most unified and distinct group coherent through a number of incorrect omissions, supplements and variant readings.", The following may be cited as examples of such omissions: 2i: 2 in tantum desidero istud aurum tuum habere, quod post inquid om. y. The omission, which is approxi- mately a normal line of text, may be supposed to have dropped out propter homoeoteleuton. If the last word in the previous line in the original of the y hyparchetype was written 1 - 4 ( =inquid = inquit; as it is written, for example, in x) and the last word in the succeeding line as q (=quod), it is quite understandable that the copyist may have happened to skip the latter line. As the text in y is meaningful despite this omission the mistake has not been observed and corrected in y. Of course it is also possible that the text in the hyparchetype is the result of a conscious curtailment made by the originator of the y recension. A propter homoeoteleuton omission disrupting both meaning and syntax is found in, for instance, 53: 31, where et qui nomen suum humiliter sperant scriptum in libro vite, hii tenent verba mea has dropped out after verba mea in y. The most extensive omission in y (2o words) is 23: 13 quia opera eius deberent esse forcia pre aliis et mundiora, ut infirmos portaret per pacienciam et per vite bone exemplum. Despite the loss of these 20 words—they constitute Christ's explanation of a simile used in the revelation— the text has maintained its logical context. For in y we find Dorsum eius velut carbo, quod tamen deberet esse sicut ebur, sed nunc est quasi carbo. This error has not arisen propter homoeoteleuton.35 The abundant crop of incorrect supplements and reading variants found in y may be exemplified by the following: 14, 9 fieri] f. aliquid (-quod Ka) y; 16, 25 diabolum] omnes dyabolos y; I, 21 tamquam] quemadmodum y; 5: 9 and 18 propter preces] ad preces y;36 14, 19 nouissimum] minutissimum y; 16, 28 intencionem] intel- ligenciam y. Finally, I would like to call attention to a passage, highly interesting from the point of view of textual criticism as well as content. It shows that the originator of the y hyparchetype does not seem to have even hesitated—if the reader will forgive the expression—to change devils into angels. In Rev. 31 Birgitta sees the Virgin Mary, Queen of Heaven, adorned with a costly crown, ornamented with 7 lilies and 7 precious stones. The significance of these symbols is interpreted for Birgitta by John the Baptist who says: 31: 6 Secundus lapis est perfectissima mundi- cia, quia ista regina celi sic pura fuit, quod una macula peccati inueniri numquam potuit in ea a principio ingressus eius in mundum usque ad ultimam diem mortis ipsius. Nec omnes diaboli tantam impuritatem reperire poterant in ea, ubi cuspis acus poni 34 It is in the y manuscripts that we find the remarkable Prague redaction of the Revelations; see above, pp. 31-33; below, pp. 57-85. 35 Respecting other omissions in y see, for example, Rev. 20, 7; 20, 27; 22: 1; 2 9, 31 ; 33, io; 50, 25 sq.; etc. 36 Concerning ad causale =propter, see my Gloss., p. 443, s.v. ad I). Cf. p. 66, n. 25, the note entered in X: ... ad pr eces meas obtinui mutuandum librum ... 
 
 
 
 
 55 posset. Ipsa vere erat purissima. Instead of diaboli, the p and a reading, y has angeli. Thus the question is whether it was diaboli, the devils, or angeli, the angels, who could not find any impuritas in Mary. Both alternatives are conceivable; this appears from the fact that neither diaboli nor angeli has been corrected in any manuscript within the respective group. The conception that the angels watch, note and report to God everything humans do is one we often meet with in Christian writers, for example, Tert. omnes angelos prospicere de caelo et singulos denotare, quis spect. 27 Dubitas blasphemiam dixerit, quis audierit, quis aures diabolo aduersus Deum ministrauerit?; Bened. reg. (ed. Hanslik) 7, 13 aestimet se homo de caelis a deo semper respici omni hora et facta sua omni loco ab aspectu diuinitatis uideri et ab angelis omni hora renun- tiari; 7, 28 ab angelis nobis deputatis cotidie die noctuque domino factorum nostrorum opera nuntiantur; Anselm. Cantuar. epist. 337, 24-26 (ed. Schmitt, V, p. 275) quia unaquaeque habet angelum suum, qui omnes cogi- certae estote (sc. moniales) tatus et actus eius videt et notat et ad iudicem deum reportat. Cf. RAC, 5, 166 f. The same conception of the angels' work is found in Birgitta's revelations. In Rev. V 4: 4-6 Christ cites the testimony of the angels on precisely Mary's purity: de hoc castitas tua fuit testimonium perhibent angeli et alii sancti, quod purior omnibus ... tua mundissima virginitas ... est in to quasi caput omnium regina propter mundiciam. Since angels virtutum Ideo merito vocaris were said to be innumerable,37 the reading omnes angeli in y undeniably has a special significance in the passage under discussion. Although it is possible to find support for the y reading angeli as the correct one, there are other and stronger reasons indicating that the reading diaboli handed down in the p and a manu- scripts is the original and correct one. The very fact that diaboli is supported by p as well as the other group of the r MSS., a, makes it in principle necessary to accept diaboli as the reading of the archetype.38 It also seems to me that in this context it is more natural and in closer agreement with other statements on the relationship between Mary and the devils in the Revelations to consider diaboli as the subject of impuritatem reperire poterant. Right from Mary's birth the devil (devils)39 had pursued her and tried to entice her to and cover her with sin and impurity,40 as is apparent, for instance, in the following passages in Birgitta's 37 See RAC, 5, ID:), 131; cf. Rev. IV I I C si computarentur omnes homines, qui nati sunt ab Adam usque ad nouissimum, qui nasciturus est in fine mundi, plus quam decem angeli inueniuntur pro vnoquoque homine .; VII 13: I I cum infinito exercitu angelorum; SA 4: 2 inenarrabilem angelorum multitudinem. " As concerns the mutual relationship between the hyparchetypes and their use for the re- construction of the archetype text, see pp. 225, 228. 39 In the Revelations both the Devil (diabolus, demon, Lucifer, etc.) and (the) devils (diaboli, demones, angeli mali, etc.; cf. below, n. 43) appear. As is well known, diabolus in the Vulgate occurs only in the sing. His servants and tools are there called, amongst other things, angeli diaboli; see below, n. 43. Cf. DTC, 4: I, 321-409; KLNM, 3, 125-138. An article dealing with devils in the Revelations was published by B. Bergh in Credo, 54 (1973), pp. 1.:)8-115. 4° See Strater II, 137-148. In view of Mary's qualities, the attempts to bring about her fall were doomed to failure, but—as an angel proclaims to Birgitta—nullus est sic bonus, quem diabolus non apponit libenter tangere temptacione (Rev. I 54: 18). 
 
 
 
 
 56 revelations: Rev. VI 56 A (Mary to Birgitta:) Quando vero ego nata fui, non latuit dyabolos, sed ... sic ipsi cogitabant: `Ecce nata est virgo quedam. Quid faciemus? Nam mirabile cernitur quoddam in ea futurum. Si adhibuerimus ei omnia retia malicie nostre, confringet ea quasi stuppas. Si inuestigamus omnia interiora eius, munita est forti presidio. Nec inuenietur in ea macula, vbi cuspis peccati infigatur. Jdeo timendum est, quod mundicia eius torquebit nos.'; IV I o8 A (Christ to Bir- gitta:) Mater igitur mea, quando et postquam nata fuit, sic erat pulcra, quod nulla er at in ea macula. Quod bene cognoscentes demones sic egre tulerunt ..., quasi quod quedam vox demonum tunc sonuisset de inferno dicens: si procedimus contra earn cum omnibus laqueis nostris, omnes ipsa dissoluit et sicut stuppe rumpuntur ... Si vero venimus contra earn cum omni malicia nostra et immundicia nostra, omnia rescindit sicut fenum rescinditur a falcastro.'; V 13: 9—I I (God to Birgitta:) Maria ... fuit vas clausum et non clausum: clausum dyabolo sed non Deo, ... dyabolus quasi torrens viciorum cupiebat totis adinuencionibus suis appropinquare cordi Marie; sed numquam ad aliquod quantumcumque minimum peccatum valuit inclinare animum eius, quia clausum erat contra temptaciones eius; V 13: 16 Maria fuit vas mundum quia tota pulchra, et tanta immundicia non inueniebatur in ea, vbi cuspis acus infigeretur. The latter passage thus in part agrees word for word with Rev. I 31: 6. Thus those who were most eager to find faults and human failings in Mary were diaboli (diabolus), demones, angeli mali.41 How is then angeli in the y manuscripts to be explained? Personally I consider that the originator of the y recension, when given the choice between diaboli and angeli, simply found it in better taste to let the angels testify that there was no impuritas or macula peccati in Mary, angelorum gloria et regina (Rev. I 5: 8)." Naturally other explanations are also conceivable." 41 Cf. Rev. I 9: 8 (Mary to Birgitta:) omnibus hominibus angeli boni dati sunt ad custodiam et angeli mali ad probacionem; 33: 6 sq. 42 In y there are a number of examples that clearly reveal that the person who drafted the y recension did not treat the Revelations with the respect and care with which verbally inspired texts are sometimes handled. The most extensive revision of the Revelations I have found in y is in Rev. III 3z which in the y version is more than twice as long as in fi and 8 (traces of the y recension are found in some 8 manuscripts, e.g. in Ne r 1 s). 48 Even as early as in Late-Latin writers and in the Vulgate angeli is occasionally used as a vox me- dia = at times boni angeli, angeli Dei (Domini), at times mali angeli, angeli diaboli (Satanae), d(a)emo- nes. The latter meaning is connected with the story of "the fallen angels"; see e.g. Vulg. apoc. 12, 9 proiectus est draco ille magnus, serpens antiquus, qui vocatur Diabolus et Satanas, ... in terram, et angeli eius cum illo missi sunt; cf. Matth. 25, 41 diabolo et angelis eius; Aug. civ. 5, 9 p. 226, 29 ff. voluntates dico seu bonorum, quos angelos Dei dicimus, seu malo- (CSEL 40: I) Angelorum rum, quos angelos diaboli vel etiam daemones appellamus; Alex. Min. (in the mid- zoo's) apoc. 7 p. 1 Io , 29 isti erant angeli, idest nuntii satanae; MW, I, 640, 40-45; TLL, II, 45, 24-71; see also Be, Fi, Hm, Nr, Sr, s.v. angelus; RAC, 5, 53-322 (esp. 188-193), s.v. Engel. Thus one could suppose that the archetype in Rev. 31: 6 had the reading angeli; if this was the case, it was handed down cor- rectly in y; but in p and 8 for the sake of clarity this reading was corrected to diaboli, the word fitting best into the context. I myself, however, do not believe in this theory since I have found no conclusive evidence in the Revelations that angeli.--- mali angeli, angeli diaboli. Whenever angeli is used in the Revelations to mean the tools of the Devil or his compeers it is always, as far as I can 
 
 
 
 
 57 The most important task now is to analyse the mutual relations between the y manuscripts. II. -12 Within the y group we can distinguish two clearly separate subgroups, which I call yl and y2 respectively, consisting of the following manuscripts: Ii: XZKaLajvwxyz (io); 12: T Ea f t (4). Both subgroups contain errors with respect to one another and other MSS., e.g. Prol. M., 18 condicionem] dileccionem (deest Z v) Ii; 141 cognoscitur] nascitur (deest f) 12; 190 confirmativa] inductiva et confirmativa (deest f) y2; Rev. 2, 34 nisi (post aliud)] quam (deest f)12; 3, 6 panis] panis et vini (deest f) y2; 13, 3o iuro] dico (deest f) post mea y, om. yi, 32, 28 quod (finale)] ut (deest f) 12; 54, 75 propter obduratum (indur- f) cor om. yi. As it is easiest in the 12 group to establish which manuscripts are codices descripti—and which for that reason are to be eliminated44—I shall first give an account of these MSS. and their mutual relations. They are all dated, so it is convenient to treat them in the following chronological order: T (1437), t (1464), Ea (1465), f (1472). The y2 MSS. T = Leipzig, Bibliothek der Karl-Marx-Universitiit, MS. 563, a. 1437, ff. I ra-4Iva (276). Lit.: Bergh 23-3o, 7o ff.; Kraft 7o, n. I, 71, n. I; Undhagen, Une source, 219. With the aid of the Explicit following Rev. VI (f. 27ivb) this MS. can be dated to 24th July 1437: Explicit liber celestium reuelacionum beate domine Brigitte sponse christi Sub anno domini Millesimo •c•c•c•c xxxvij Jn vigilia sancti Jacobi appostoli (!) per manus et non per pedes (!).45 The humorous scribe also discloses his name and from where he comes, since before the Explicit we read: Dus ra con de ameneburg conuerte sic fit tibi nomen apperte" et sic est finis ipsius libri. This Conradus de Ameneburg47 has written the majority of the contents of T. Certain corrections discover, given an elucidatory attribute such as mali (e.g. Rev. I 9: 8; 33: 7; II 20: 5), inobedientes (e.g. SA 4: 9). Cf. ES i C (med.) angelus sathane sepe sub angeli lucis specie se transformat. It would thus seem to be significant that angeli in this "devilish" meaning requires an elucidating complement (cf. the above-cited example from Alexander Minorita). If we assume that angeli diaboli ("the angels of the Devil") existed in the above-discussed section of the text, then both the readings handed down, angeli resp. diaboli, could easily be explained both as a mechanical error (propter homoeoteleuton) and—in view of what has been said above—as a conscious emendation. This explanation, however, does not seem to be particularly probable as the expression angeli diaboli does not appear to occur in the Revelations. 44 See Maas 5, 7; West 33 f., 43 ff. 45 Cf. Bergh 23, n. 5. 46 Bergh 23, n. 5, does not seem to have noticed that the scribe's name really is to be found in the MS. 47 The town of Amoneburg is not far from Marburg in Hessen.

 59 The majority of this one-column paper manuscript was completed by the 26th June 1464, at the twelfth hour; this is seen from the following Explicit after Rev. VII, f. 479v: Explicit liber celestium reuelacionum beate domine brigitte sponse christi Sub anno dominj Millesimo cccc° lxiizj .7n die sanctorum martirum Johannis et Pauli hora xzj. The rest of the contents (see below) was probably written out in the same year. Contents ff. 7r-9v: List of the rubrics to Rev. I: Ad honorem summi patris ...

As I shall show below, Ea, completed in 1465 according to the Explicit after Rev. VII (f. 456 va),66 is a carelessly executed transcription of T in corrected form (T2). 58 Cf. T, p. 58. 59 This is also the case in T and Ea; see pp. 58, 6o. 60 After ch. 130 follows the Explicit to Book IV, f. 307r. Under the rubric Jncipiunt reuelaciones que vise seu facte sunt in monte gargano de excellencia angelorum there follow (ff. 307"-318r) the same 16 revelations as in T and certain other MSS.; see p. 58. 61 Ch. 1 has by mistake been numbered cx owing to the fact that it is immediately preceded by the list rubric to ch. cix. 62 On this prologue see Bergh 22, 113; above, p. 32. 43 See Hollman 52. 64 The scribe's reason for copying this bull is clear from the following words that precede the text of the actual bull: Necessarium et valde vtile esse uidetur hic in publicum ponere Copiam Bulle Canonizacionis sancte brigitte propter emulos eius et eos qui dicunt quod reuelaciones eius non sunt ab ecclesia assumpte. 66 See above, p. 3, n. 1 2. 66 Explicit liber celestium reuelacionum beate domine brigitte sponse cristi etcetera Anno domini Millesimo quadragintesimo (f; mis-spelling of quadringentesimo) sexagesimo quinto in vigilia donati etcetera. 
 
 
 
 
 6o Contents ff. Ira-3rb: List of the rubrics to Rev. I: Ad honorem summi patris Jncipit primus liber continens etc.67 Most of the rubrics are unnumbered, of those numbered the majority are incorrectly numbered. Further, in some cases they are in inverted order, since they are entered in the following order: i -2, 4_5, 3,68 6-16, 18, 17,69 19-56, 58,69 57, 59-60. ff. 3rb—bra: Prol. M. After Yncipitit (!) prologus szvecia70 follows Et habentur hec verba jeremie 5° capitulo ...; i.e. the opening words of the prologue are to be found in Jer. 5.71 ff. 6ra-6o': Rev. I (without text rubrics72). Decl. 13, 16, 23, 28 and 32 are found incorporated with the previous text in the respective chapters. Thus none of these supplements is marked as declaracio.73 Then there follows: on f. 6o' Rev. II, on f. I o2vb ES, on f. 119" Rev. VIII, on f. 179" Rev. III, on f. 2I3vb Rev. IV, on f. 318' SA, on f. 336" Rev. V, on f. 362ya Rev. VI and on f. 429vb Rev. VII.74 f = Stockholm, Kungliga Biblioteket, MS. A 68, a. 1472, ff. 185, I97ra-207va (252). Lit.: Bergh 24-26, 32; Hollman 49; Kraft 7o, n. I, 73, n. I. In its present incomplete form, f consists of 252 paper leaves. An older, most probably original, numbering is found on the recto pages of the following leaves: 185, 197-440. The last preserved leaves, 441-447, have been numbered in pencil in modern times. With the help of the older numbering we can con- clude that 195 leaves have been lost, namely, ff. 1-184 and 186-196. Since the text at the end of the manuscript is incomplete it is clear that a number of other leaves have been removed from the manuscript. After the concluding words emisit spiritum in Rev. VII 31, on f. 422", there is: finis sub anno 13A2 (=1372). The figure 3 is not original. It has been written upon A. ( =4). Thus it would seem that 1472 was earlier written, the date which Kraft and Hollman give as the year of origin of the manuscript. I share their opinion.75 See above, p. 58, n. 5o. In T, which is the original of Ea, the rubric to ch. 3 was, by mistake, at first left out. However, following the discovery of the mistake, the rubric has been entered after the appropriate insertion sign in the lower margin of f. I r. The scribe of Ea would not seem to have noticed this correction before he had already copied out the rubric to ch. 5; cf. below, pp. 62 f. 69 The same incorrect placing of this rubric is found in T and t. In T, however, the mistake has later been corrected. This correction has either not been noticed by the scribes of Ea and t, or not been made until after Ea and t had been copied from T; cf. p. 63. 7° See the critical app. of this edition, p. 229, I (the reading of n Gh). 71 I.e. Jer. 5, 3o; see the app. sim. of this ed., p. 229, 2. The same—or similar—information is found in both the closely related manuscripts T and t, in the y1 manuscripts j La w x y z plus in A K and P; see p. 169 with footn. 16 and 17. 72 On the arrangement of the rubrics in the manuscripts see pp. 225 f. 7° That also these Decl. in Ea have been copied from T has been conclusively proved; see pp. 217, 222 f. 74 Concerning this order of the Revelation books, which is characteristic of the y manuscripts, see pp. 32 f. 75 Bergh 24 maintains that this date cannot be considered reliable as, in his opinion, the last two numbers have been entered by a later hand in rasura. The corrector is assumed to have done this because he thought the date referred to the year of Birgitta's death which according to—an incorrect—tradition was 1372. In actual fact Birgitta died in 1373; see Undhagen 12o-123, 133. From Bergh's description it is not clear whether by this "later hand" he means the same hand that 67 68 
 
 
 
 
 61 Of Rev. I cod. f contains only chs. zo, 47-22, 3o (muftis profuturo . . . omnes vide<at>) and 45, I I-6o, 41 (homo ... placuerit). These chapters have been given text rubrics; but these are shorter and differently constructed from those found in other manu- scripts. The rest of Rev. I and the whole of Prol. M. have most certainly been entered on some of the leaves now missing from the manuscript (see above)." The rest of the contents of f agrees on the whole with those of T (see p. 58), which seems to have been the original of f. After Rev. I follow Rev. II (f. 207vb), ES (f. 229rb),77 Rev. VIII (f. 2301, III (f. 26ovb), IV (f. 279rb), SA (f. 336ra), Rev. V (f. 349ra), VI (f. 364ra), VII (f. 4o6rb); ff. 422°a-426rb contain supplementary material to Rev. IV, VI and VII. It ends with Gloria tibi sancta trinitas. The end of the manu- script (from f. 426va incl.) is taken up by non-Birgittine texts.78 T —t Ea f As I shall show, T, the oldest of the y, manuscripts, has obviously been used as the original of the three other manuscripts within the group. The text of T has been corrected, interpolated, added to and provided with a large number of marginal notes. This has been done by more than one hand and at different times. Certain changes in the text indicate the influence of a and were presumably done at the same time as the supplementary material was added to the manuscript.79 As we shall see, it is the amended version of T, here below called T2, that we find copied in t, Ea and f.80 This fact may be illustrated by the following example. After the final word penitencia in Rev. 14, 3o the scribe of T has indicated, by means of the insertion mark A, that the following words, written by him in the lower margin, should be entered in the text: Tercius videbit faciem meam semper et ineternum et habebit omne gaudium. This false supplement81 was then incorporated has written 3 upon the A.( = 4). In my opinion this later "correction" was done by a hand different from that which wrote i),IL 2, since it seems to me unlikely that if the same person had intended to change the last three figures he would only have scraped away the last two. 78 I have no idea what else the lost leaves might have contained. " Only a summary of chs. 1-3 +the whole of ch. 8. In T there are all 8 chs. of ES; see p. 58. 78 The text on f. 426°, beginning Collegerunt pontiffices (!) et pharisei concilium, has been attributed to Simon de Cascia (t 1348; see LTK, 9, 766 f.) in a pencil annotation entered in modern times in the upper margin of the same page; cf., however, Little, Initia, P. 49, where Bernardinus of Sienna (f 1444; see DHGE, 8, 803 f.; LTK, 2, 252 f.) is given as the author of a sermon with the same introduction. On f. 427ra, under the rubric De conuersione capitulum primum, a new section of the text begins with the words Ne tardes conuerti. The author is most probably Richard Rolle de Hampole (t 1 349; see Emden III, 1586 f.; LTK, 8, 1292 f.), as is given in an annotation entered on f. 427r in pencil in modern times; cf. Little, Initia, p. 148. 79 See above, p. 58, n. 53; below, pp. 84 ff., 145 f., 217. 80 Cf. Bergh 22-26, 31 f.; Eklund—Leby 22, 34-4o. 81 One can understand why the corrector of T was tempted to add Tercius etc., as the logical parallelism in Rev. 14: 3-6 calls for: Tria ... sunt genera hominum seruiencium ... Primi ... Secundi ... Tercii ... Primus ... Secundus ... Cf. the corresponding supplement in 0a2: Tercius vero eternaliter mecum gaudebit (see the app. crit.). The third member missed by the correctors of T and Oa in the revelation's text has, however, a counterpart in the words Isti vero merentur audiri in prece sua, quia voluntas eorum est secundum voluntatem meam (Rev. 14, 26 f.), which tell us what reward 
 
 
 
 
 62 into the text by the scribes of t and Ea. The considerably defective f lacks, for instance, the whole of chapter 14,82 but its dependence upon T can be illustrated by other examples such as 52, 47 where T t Ea instead of cicius liquescit have cicius inpingwescit (in pigw- T pingw- t) et liquescit. After cicius, which is at the end of a line in the left column, T2, following the insertion mark A, has inserted pauent in the centre margin; the scribe of f has misunderstood this correction in his exemplar and written cicius pauent et (et is probably f's own emendation of T's in) piguescit et liquescit. The insertion mark after cicius refers in actual fact to a place in the right-hand column on the same page of the manuscript where an erroneous ponent in Rev. 53, 18 has been crossed out and replaced by the insertion mark A. Thus T2 has wished to correct this ponent to pauent. T —t Ea Of t and Ea, t is without doubt the better transcription. This is shown, for instance, by the way the two scribes have treated the numerous marginal notes in T2. The scribe of t generally interprets these correctly, whereas the Ea copyist has understood them to be textual corrections and has entered them in the text itself. At Prol. M., 152 Diabolus tripliciter peccauit, T2, for example, provides the follow- ing marginal note: Diabolus tripliciter peccauit et tribus peccatis mundum repleuit (cf. Prol. M., 156 f.). This note appears unchanged in t's margin except for mundum placed before tribus, whereas Ea has et tribus peccatis mundum repleuit in the text itself after peccauit (v. 152). At Prol. M., 66 Spiritus enim grandis, T2 has written spiritus grandis quid est in the margin. The same note is found copied into the margin of t, whereas in Ea it is entered in the text itself instead of Spiritus enim grandis. Sometimes t and Ea have the same erroneous reading as compared with T, which might lead us to suspect that Ea has been copied from t; for example, Rev. 32, 21 where t and Ea have the reading Quia instead of et. However, the explanation of this deviation from T is most likely that the scribes of t and Ea have quite independently misread T's abbreviation of et which could easily be mistaken for that of quia. Such a mistake was all the more easily made since quia fits excellently into the text. We can conclude that t is not the original of Ea, as t has certain omissions that Ea does not have; for example, Prol. M., 156 ut loco mei regnare potuisset om. t (b cl D). Certain T2 readings have not been transferred to t Ea, for example, 5, 41 where T2 has the correct reading edzficaui entered in the margin after the reference mark • • ., which is also found in the text above the corresponding word in Tl, sanctificaui. The latter reading, which is also found in t Ea and the yl manuscripts j La, closely related to T,83 does not seem to have been crossed out by the corrector awaits the third category of God's servants. As seen above, the so-called numerical composition (cf. above, p. 2o, n. 81) so often used in the Revelations, is not always consistently carried out; cf. Rev. 45: 9 (with app. sim.). 82 See above, p. 61. 83 See below, pp. 84 f., 223. 
 
 
 
 
 63 of T, indicating that he was not sure which of the readings was the original one. The same uncertainty may be the reason why the scribes of t and Ea preserve T's original reading sanctificaui. It is also, of course, possible, indeed probable, that edificaui had not yet been entered in T's margin when t and Ea were transcribed from it. There are several readings in T2 which are not found in t and Ea and must therefore be assumed to have been entered in T after t and Ea were written; for example, 4, 23 cum (post tecum) propter homoeoteleuton om. T' t Ea (D deest f) si supra lin. T2. Thus the relationship within the y, group may be illustrated by the following stemma codicum: T t Ea f Readings from t Ea f are not given in the following account of the mutual re- lationships between the manuscripts and their value in reconstructing the text of the archetype, as these have proved to be codices descripti.

 65 with the transcription. It is clear from the Explicit after Rev. VII, f. 284va, that the manuscript was completed in z 3 9 4: Explicit liber celestium reuelacionum beate birgide (!)13 sponse christi Sub anno domini M° trecentesimo nonagesimo finitus.' 4 After this Explicit, which has been entered by the same hand as the preceding text, there follow, f. 284vb, four Leonine hexameters15 and the following details concerning the owner of the manuscript written in a different style (Gothic minuscule) and apparently by another hand: janussij clobutyensis alias Cropacz liber suprascriptus est. pragensy .7n studio comparatus;'6 i.e. "the book written above" ( = cod. X) "belongs to Jan from Kiobucko alias Cropacz who boughtv it at the university of Prague". Like v and w,'8 X would thus seem to have been written in Prague at the request of Johannes19 Kropacz.20 The information that it was bought Pragensi in studio is extremely interesting. There seems to be every reason to believe that Kropacz studied at this university,21 where—as in the whole of Bohemia—interest in Birgitta and her Revelations seems to have been very great during the end of the ipo's.22 At this time one of the most famous (within Bir- gittine circles) countrymen of Kropacz, Magister Matheus de Cracouia, studied 13 14 15 Cf. Undhagen, Un acrostiche, 128, n. 23. Printed in Kraft, NTBB, 13, 156; Westman 266. Wlnera que dominus est passus corpore christus Milia sunt quinque septem vicibus deca lunge. Et quadraginta socias iungas quoque pentha Tot fertur christus pro nobis wlnera passus. The occurrence of these lines in X does not seem to have been commented on by other scholars. 16 According to Kraft (NTBB, 13, 156) there is janusszj etc. in conjunction with finitus in the Explicit cited above. The reader is also given this erroneous interpretation in Westman z66 and Collijn, NTBB, 13, p. 28. 17 For the interpretation of comparatus see (v) p. 7o with footn. 61 and (w) pp. 67 f. 18 See pp. 67-70. 10 The name form Janussius(=Johannes) appears also in w; see below, p. 67, n. 35. 20 After the Explicit to Rev. 117 there is (f. I76rb) the following piece of information: Liber iste est comparatus per dominum andream prage. This note is cited by Truhlaf I, 559, Westman 266 and Kraft, NTBB, 13, 156 without comment. Its significance is, however, not entirely clear. This much may be said: both the "Master Andreas" mentioned here and the above Johannes Kropacz once had the manuscript in their possession; cf. below. 21 The university was founded in 1348 by Charles IV (t 1378), King of the Romans and King of Bohemia; see Rashdall II, 211-234; cf. C. Tarnqvist, 'Svenska studenter i Prag under medel- tiden', KA, 29 (1929), 235-298. In this connection I should like to remind the reader that both Charles IV and his son Wenceslaus IV (see above [x] p. 64 with footn. 2) were great admirers of Birgitta and her Revelations. In Sept. 1377 the former petitioned for her canonization; see ACIP, 53 f.; Hojer 1 o6. 22 We can conclude this from the fact, among others, that a nuncius Studij Pragensis was sent around 138o to Rome pro libris Reuelacionum habendis; see Undhagen, Une source, 225, 16 ff.; above p. 26., n. 107. Consequently it must be assumed that a copy of an Alfonso redaction of the Revela- tions was in the possession of Prague University as early as the beginning of the 1380's. Judging by the y manuscripts we can conclude that this redaction underwent a thorough revision in Prague during the 2380's; see pp. 32-33, 54 if• 7 — 774372 
 
 
 
 
 66 and taught at the university.23 Probably it is not rash to assume that there were lectures on the Revelations in Prague while Kropacz was there. It seems plausible that Kropacz then obtained from some stationarius24 the three transcriptions of the Revelations found in X, w and v, written in 1394, 1396 and 1400 respectively. Kropacz evidently took two of these home with him to Poland (w and v; see below, pp. 67-71), whilst the third and oldest, X, remained in Prague.25 As regards the contents and their arrangement X agrees most nearly with w.26 The following section of the contents is of interest for this edition: f. I": The beginning of an alphabetical table of contents to the Rev. (<A>Bstinencia om- f. nium membrorum Amici dei ...). Ivb: blank. This Matheus of Krakow, who became magister in artibus in 1367 and magister in theologia in 1384 in Prague, was a member of the commission appointed by Pope Urban VI at the end of 1378 to examine the Revelations. Matheus is said to have himself put forward a proposition for Birgitta's canonization; see Ekwall 115-118 (some of the authoress's details should be taken cum grano salis; see Bergh 17, n. 6; above pp. 31 f.); HOjer to8 f.; Undhagen, Une source, 225 § 15; West- man 22, n. 6, 291. As was mentioned above, it is very tempting to assume that the y redaction of the Revelations is to a great extent the work of Matheus of Krakow. On this remarkable man and his career see DTC, to: 1, 389-392; LTK, 7, 174 f.; Stammler—Langosch III, 294-298 (with further references). 24 During the Middle Ages a more or less permanent bookshop was established at the University. To the so-called stationarii (booksellers) was entrusted the task of having manuscripts copied; these were then lent or sold to the students. When they had completed their studies and were going to leave the University the students were bound to return or sell back their manuscripts—something which, however, they seem often to have omitted to do; see S. Dahl, Nordisk hdndbog i bibliotekskundskab, I, Kobenhavn, 1 957, 462-464; id., Bokens historia, Stockholm, 1961, 64 f.; Kirchner—Loffler—Olb- rich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, III, 325 f., s.v.

Buchschreiber; Leyh, Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, I, 866-873; Rashdall 189 ff., 421 ff. 25 On the front fly-leaf there is a very interesting note (see below) entered on the 18th May 1411 by the owner of the manuscript, who may have been Johannes Kropacz himself (cf. above, footn. zo). He relates that on this given date he left cod. X as security in the monastery of Mons Syon or Strahowia (a Premonstratensian monastery in Prague; see Graesse—Benedict—Plechl III, 424; LTK, 9, 1102 f.) in order to borrow Aurora, or verse Bible, written by a certain Petrus. This Petrus can be identified as Petrus Riga (f 1209), Canon of Notre Dame at Reims and later a Canon Regular of the Order of St. Augustine at St. Denis in the same city. He earned a great reputation by his Aurora, the most popular verse Bible or verse commentary on the Bible in the Middle Ages. A modern critical edition of this work has been published in 1965 by Paul E. Beichner: Aurora, Petri Rigae Biblia Versificata, A Verse Commentary on the Bible, I—II (Publications in Mediaeval Studies, 19), Notre Dame, Indiana. In the preface to his work Petrus states that he wrote Aurora at the ut librum stilo metrico deping- instance of his fellow-students: Frequens sodalium meorum peticio erem persuasit (see Beichner's ed. I, p. 7; cf. below). The note entered in X (earlier printed in Truhlaf I, 559 and—with a number of errors—in Kraft, NTBB, 13, 156, n. 5) reads Anno domini 23 M° ccccxj° feria ij dominica Vocem iocunditatis librum presentem videlicet Visiones beate Brytte in monte syon alias in Strahowia reposui Cuius loco ad preces meas obtinui mutuandum librum qui intytula- tur petrus Aurora alias Biblia versifice in pargameno scripta Cuius principium sic incipit Frequens sodalium meorum peticio Finis autem Facta prioris Adam deleuit in arbore quadam. 26 See below, pp. 67 f.; Kraft, NTBB, 13, 156; Westman 266 f.

Cod. w consists of 271 leaves numbered in modern times, 263 of which contain Birgitta's Revelations. The text was entered by the same hand throughout in two columns per page. At the end of the manuscript, f. 263va, after Rev. VII, there is the following Explicit written in a different style and—presumably—by a different hand from that of the preceding text: Expliciunt omnes reuelaciones Beate Byrgytte ducisse Swecie. Anno domini Millesimo Tricentesimo nonogesimon sexto Conparate32 prage per iohannem dittum33 Cropacz orate pro eo. This Explicit, which almost entirely agrees with that in v,34 tells us that the transcription of the Revelations in w was carried out in Prague in 13 9 6 at the order of Johannes Kropacz.35 Westman maintains, firstly that Kropacz himself wrote out both w and X, and secondly omnia incorrect for lx or sexaginta; cf. w p. 68, n. 41. On this rubric see p. 226. 29 See above, p. 38. 30 See p. 217 with n. 6. 31 nonogesimus (probably influenced by octogesimus) = nonagesimus, attested since "ca. 1295" according to Latham 314 s.v. nona. 32 See below (v), p. 7o with footn. 61. 83 dittum=dictum; see Leumann 152 f.; Sommer 240; Vaananen 67 f. 34 See p. 69. " See below (v), pp. 69 f.. The name of the manuscript's owner is found written out in several places in the MS.; this has earlier been pointed out by Westman 267 (in Westman the folio numbers are three units higher than in the manuscript itself; I follow the manuscript numbering). Thus, for example, on f. 99" (after the list of rubrics to Rev. III; cf. v, p. 69, n. 57) there is iohannis de clobuk, on f. 210ra (in Rev. VI) johannes cropacz, on f. 223" (in Rev. VI) janussius (cf. X, p. 65 with footn. 16 and 19). A fly-leaf at the end of the MS. is made up of a document from 1395 in which this same person is mentioned as clericus and witness: Sub Anno ... domini Millesimo • ccc • xc quinto ...

 68 that w "to all appearances" is a transcript of X.36 Neither of these assertions would seem to be correct. As will be suggested in the discussion of v,37 comparare in the Explicit in w and X38 most probably does not have the meaning Westman appears to assume.39 Further X (written in 1394) contains at least one error that seems to preclude the possibility of X having been the original of VV.4° Everything points to w and X having been copied from a common source in Prague.

 69 in modern times." However, the manuscript was originally of greater extent. Of the first three leaves only a few fragments of fol. i and 2 remain, whilst fol. 3 is completely missing. Further there is a leaf missing between ff. 10 and i I, two leaves missing between ff. 15 and 16 and two leaves between ff. 18o (170) and 181 (171) (see below).50 The manuscript is illuminated with several miniatures and historiated initials51, and bound in a typical "Lederschnittband"; the covers are ornamented with four medallions representing different saints, one of whom is Saint Birgitta. In each of the seven spine panels there is a letter carved. Together, these letters form the name kropacz. This probably refers, not to the master craftsman of the binding (as Prof. Bollert assumes),52 but to the owner of the manuscript whose name is found written out in full in the Explicit after Rev.

Plocc. 39), Bersohn 18-2o states that it was the above-mentioned Kropacz himself who copied the manu- script.60 There is, however, no reason to interpret comparate in the above-cited 49 Fol. 36 has by mistake been designated 26, with the result that all the subsequent leaves have been numbered ten units too low. In my description of the contents the incorrect numbering is found within brackets. 50 The loss of these leaves would seem to have occurred during the Second World War when the manuscript, to judge from the microfilm, appears also to have been damaged by damp and smoke. 51 For further details see Bersohn 17-20 (with Figs. 10-14); cf. S. Sawicka, 'Les principaux manuscrits a peintures de la Bibliotheque du seminaire de Plock' (Bulletin de la Societe franfaise de reproductions de manuscrits a peintures, 198 annee, Paris, 1938, 233-253), P. 234. 52 See Collijn, NTBB, 13, p. 28; cf. Bersohn 20. I do not know whether the "Lederschnittband" is still in the same excellent condition as in 1925 when Bollert published his work referred to here, i.e. Lederschnittbiinde des XIV. Jahrhunderts (reviewed by Collijn in NTBB, 13, 27 f.). 59 See above, n. 49. 54 In the MS. is found mille° which Collijn (NTBB, 13, 28) incorrectly interprets as mille. 55 This Explicit is written in a different style (Gothic minuscule)—and probably by another hand—from that of the previous text (Gothic italics). 56 Klobucko is situated about 15 km north-west of Czestochowa (famous for its monastery Jasna GOra, founded at the end of the 13oo's; see LTK, 3, Ito f.) and about iio km north-west of Krakow, Poland. He 57 The owner's name, kropacz, is also found after the list of rubrics to Rev.

Its famous cathedral was built in the 11th cent.; see LTK, 8, 563. Cf. Z, pp. 72 f. 59 Mrs Leokadia Posten, Assist. Librarian of Lund University Library, has kindly translated the relevant pages of this work for me. 60 Collijn (NTBB, 13, 28) leaves this question open, pending "a future investigation", by which is probably meant an essay in preparation by Prof. A. Birkenmajer on codd. v, w, and X (see pp. 64-68) which is reported by Kraft in NTBB, 13, 156, n. 3. As far as I am aware the promised study has not yet been published, in any case not in NTBB.

The text of Book I has certain lacunae as one leaf was damaged and three have been removed from the manuscript. An upper corner of f. 1 with the text of Rev.

Like the other yi manuscripts (see p. 217) v has no Decl. in Book I. As regards these, the scribe refers the reader to in fine sexti (libri) at the end of chs. 13, 17, 23 and 28.64 Such a reference was probably also found at the end of ch. 32, now missing from the manuscript, as was mentioned above.

Ossecensis 41, a. 1401, ff. I Lit.: Westman 271; Wohlmann 136. This manuscript, which is now kept in the University Library (Universtni Knihovna) in Prague, has earlier belonged to the Cistercian monastery of Qsek70 in northern Bohemia. According to the Explicit after Rev. VI (see below) this book was completed on Whitsun Eve 140171 by a scribe calling himself A. de B. Presumably the whole manuscript was written in that year. It now consists of 284 paper leaves written in two columns per page and numbered in modern times.72 Before this numbering was done the manuscript most probably contained at least eighteen more leaves, since according to my calculations there are about 13 leaves missing from Rev. I (see below) and since according to Wohlmann five leaves have been removed after Rev. VII at the end of the manuscript. Contents ff. 1 ra-2va: List of the rubrics to Rev.

The text of the Vita, Ecce descripsi earn tibi ... Amen, is preceded by the rubric Jncipit legenda sancte brigide leccio prima. This vita or legenda, divided into nine lecciones—as is also the case in v—is included in Birger Gregersson's Officium Sancte Birgitte, edited by Undhagen in 196o (see the Bibliography, p. 'Dux). Its occurrence in v—and Z (see below, p. 73)—was then unknown to the editor. The legenda in v is unfortunately not complete, since two leaves containing the text of lecciones V 3 p. 199, 21 (Erat ...)—VIII 23 p. 217, 2 (... via) are missing between if. i8o (170) and 181 (i7i). 69 Cf. Z, p. 73; above, p. 3. 70 On this monastery see LTK, 7, 1268; cf. Graesse—Benedict—Plechl III, 83 s.v. Osseca. In his Verzeichniss der Handschriften in der Bibliotek des Stiftes Ossegg, p. 136, Wohlmann cites, among other passages from the manuscript, the Explicit after SA (f. 194'1', in the manuscript: f. 193v1'). Through incorrectly reading in Svaczensi (instead of Watzenensi=Watzstenensi) monasterio Wohl- mann has been led to believe that the text of the manuscript was meant not for the nuns of Vadstena but for the nuns in "Schwaz (Bez. Teplitz), Kloster der Grabeshiiterinnen" situated in the same part of Czechoslovakia as Qsek. 71 Wohlmann incorrectly gives the year 1441. 72 In this numbering fol. 3 has been marked fol. 2 by mistake and thus the numbers of the sub- sequent leaves are a unit too low. In my account of the contents I have g ven the correct number. n On this rubric see p. 226. 74 Here Wohlmann incorrectly reads feminae. 75 Concerning this supplement, et habentur ... capitulo, see p. 169. 75a On rubrica ... ante see p. 225, n.

 72 sexaginta capitula ... Et sic est finis liber primus (!). Between ff. 12 and 13 approximately 13 leaves containing the text of Rev. 1 17: 2 — 41: 47 (abscidam profunde) have been lost. There is no supplementary material. However, at the end of ch. 13 there is the refer- ence Declaracionem require in fine sexti capituli (!)76 showing that the author of this refer- ence intended to enter Decl. 13 "at the end of the sixth chapter"; by this he probably meant "at the end of the sixth b o o k".76 This supplement has, however, never been entered in the manuscript. After this follow: List of the rubrics to Rev. II (ff. 25"-26"), Rev. II (without text rubrics; ff. 26va-48va), ES (8 chs. with text rubrics to chs. z-6, 8; ff. 48"-5 8vb), Rev.

In its present form this manuscript consists of 234 paper leaves, 42 X 3o cm, divided into two columns per page. Only a few of the leaves are numbered and these in modern times. For the most part the contents of Z agree with those of v and it is obvious that both these manuscripts had originally the same content.79 As a result of careless binding certain sections of text are not in the correct order; indeed, to all appearances a whole quire, containing a list of the rubrics to Rev. I, the text of Rev. I 1-21: 2 Ego plus the whole of Prol. M., has been forgotten. At the end of the manuscript, on f. 234vb, the following Explicit is found: Explicit legenda vna cum bulla Canonisacionis beate Byrgitte alias Brigide sponse christi80 vna cum alijs libris superius scriptis ffinita Sabbato infra octauas beati Jacobi Apostoli gloriosi Per manus Martini Alberti de Szacroczim Plocensis diocesis Sub anno domini Millesimo Quadringentesimo tercio.

 73 of Plock.81 In this connection I would remind the reader that cod. v, now pre- served in Biblioteka Narodowa, Warsaw, earlier belonged to the Cathedral Lib- rary of the diocesan capital Plock. Because of the similar contents of these two manuscripts and their connections with Plock, Kraft supposes Z to be a copy of v.82 However, as I shall show, certain errores separativi in v compared to Z preclude such a relationship!' As regards the contents and their arrangement in Z I refer the reader to Kraft, NTBB, 13, 157 ff., and to my description of v (pp. 68-71). I shall here only de- scribe the following texts in Z: Contents ff. _mt._ 3Orb: Rev. I 21: 2-60: I0 (inquit antequani caream83 placuerit. Et sic est finis primi libri Explicit). There are no text rubrics. As was mentioned above, the remainder of Rev. I, the list of rubrics to Rev. I and the whole of Prol. M. are missing. No Decl. are entered, but at the end of chs. 23, 28 and 32 there is again the reference declaracio in fine sexti so typical of the y manuscripts. This reference was probably also found at the end of chs. 13 and 17,84 now missing in Z. ff. 226ra-23Ira: Vita sancte Birgitte, composed by Birgerus Gregorii, Archbishop of Upp- sala. 85 ff . 23 Ira Boniface IX's Bulla canonizacionis sancte Birgitte, dated 7th Oct. 1391.86 Thereafter follows the above-cited Explicit. La = Leipzig, Bibliothek der Karl-Marx-Universitlit, MS. 562, a. 1406, ff. 1m-48ra (212). Cod. La, which consists of 212 leaves numbered in modern times, originally belonged to the famous Cistercian monastery Altzelle in Sachsen. We can con- clude this from the following provenance note entered in the lower margins of ff. 3v-4v: LIBER UETERIS CELLE SANCTE MARIE.87 The manuscript ends 81 By Szacroczim is probably meant Zakroczym, situated some 6o km south-east of Plock and about 3o km north-west of Warsaw, Poland. On Plock see v, p. 69, n. 58. In the Explicit after SA, f. 144", another scribe is mentioned: Explicit Liber Quartus sancte Brigitte ad Reges (!) et lecciones de domina per manus Nicolai etcetera. Whether this Nicolaus really copied out Rev. IV and SA in Z or whether, as Truhlif (loc. cit.) asserts, he was merely "rubricator codicis atque pictor deauratorque lit. initialium ...", I am not in a position to judge until I have seen the manuscript itself; cf. Kraft, NTBB, 13, 157, n. 2. 82 NTBB, 13, 158, n. 2. 82a See below, pp. 78, 81, cf. pp. 82 f. with n. 14.1. 83 After inquit 9 words have been left out in Z and the other y manuscripts; see the crit. app. of this ed. p. 297, 7. 84 Cf. v, p. 7o. 85 See v, p. 71, n. 68. 86 See v, p. 71, n. 69. 87 This monastery, founded in the I7o's, was an important cultural centre in the Middle Ages. After the dissolving of the monastery in 1540 its magnificent library was given to the University Library in Leipzig which was founded in 1543; regarding this see DHGE, 2, 846; LTK, 1, 406 f.; Loftier, Deutsche Klosterbibliotheken, pp. 66, 242-244; Loftier—Kirchner—Olbrich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, II, 314 s.v.

There is no supplementary material, but references at the end of chapters 13,94 17,95 23,96 28,97 and 3298 indicate that it was intended that the Decl. to these chapters should be entered at the end of Book VI.99 Further it is worth mentioning that at the beginning of the first chapter of Book I there is a miniature of St. Birgitta writing at a desk. 4.8ra_ ra: List of the rubrics to Rev.

Cod. z is a paper manuscript written in two columns per page and completed on Tuesday the 15th March 1407 by a certain Thomas; this is apparent from the following Explicit after Rev. VII, f. 394vb: Explicit liber celestium revelacionum be- ate brigide sponse christi Sub Anno domini M° cccc° vij° finitus tercia feria post Judica per manus thome.101- The leaves are unnumbered, with the exception of a few numbered in modern times. The Revelation books are entered in the order typical of the y manuscripts, but as regards the arrangement of the rubrics z diverges in several respects from the other y manuscripts. For example, unlike most y manuscripts, Rev. I has only text rubrics and no list rubrics.l02 Contents ff. Ira —3': Prol. M.: AAd (!) honorem summi patris Jncipit primus liber continens in se lx editus per ... ut sequitur.103 Jncipit prologus in libro reuelacionum celestium capitula magistrum Mathiam de szoeciaughabentur hec verba jeremie quinto capitulom Sequitur STupor fatebantur. 100 After Rev. IV 8o follow the above (p. 74) printed verses. As the list of rubrics also contains the rubrics to Rev. IV 81-13o one might have expected the scribe to have entered the text to these chapters, too. It is possible that the text of the latter chapters was to be found in another part of La, now lost. This conjectured part, if it existed, probably also contained the same reve- lations that follow after Rev. IV in other y manuscripts, for example, in j, which is very closely rel- ated to La; see above, p. 72, n. 77. 101 After this Explicit another, contemporaneous, hand has entered the following note: Beata Bri- gitta obit in Scocia sub Justino Jmperatore qui Cepit anno 517 et Jmperauit annis nouem. Thus the author of this note has confused the Swedish saint with St. Brigida of Kildare in Ireland whose cult was very widespread during the whole of the Middle Ages. She did indeed die "when Justinus was Emperor" (518-527) in the Eastern Roman Empire, more exactly in the year 523; see DHGE, 1o, 716-719; LTK, 2, 694; 5, 1224; cf. E. Fogelklou, Bortom Birgitta, Stockholm, 1941, pp. 58 ff.; T. Schmid, 'Le culte en Suede de Sainte Brigide l'Irlandaise' (Analecta Bollandiana, 6z, 1o8—ii5). On Scocia (Scotia)= Hibernia, 'Ireland', see Graesse—Benedict—Plechl II, 237; III, 35o. Perhaps the confusion between the two saints has arisen from a confusion between their homelands, Swecia resp. Scocia. 102 In z only Rev. V has list rubrics; cf. Kraft, NTBB, 13, 1 6 4. 103 On this rubric see p. 226. 1" See the crit. app. of this ed., p. 229, I. 105 Concerning this supplement (habentur capitulo), see p. 169.

According to Wislocki it was written at the beginning of the I400's. The leaves have been given both page and folio numbering in modern times. At the latter numbering the page numbers have been crossed out. The beginning of the manuscript (pp. 1-96) comprises, according to Wislocki, the Super cantica canticorum.112 The rest of the manuscript is taken up with Birgittine texts. As a result of careless binding Prol. M. and the first half of Rev. I have been placed at the end of the manuscript. However, with the help of references a correc- tor, contemporaneous with the scribe, has informed the reader of this error, ff. 49ra resp. 168vb. There are no initials at the beginning of the chapters, nor, in general, are there chapter numbers. Contents ff. /4,,6ra_ 150": Prol. M.: <S>Tupor fatebantur.

The author of these references, which are found in most of the y manu- scripts113, has obviously intended the Decl. to be entered at the end of Rev.

The manuscript provides no information on date or origin. Presumably a date was given at the end of a third part of the same manuscript, in all probability now lost; see below, n. xi8. Truhlat, loc. cit., dates y to "saec. XIV—XV" and Kraft, loc. cit., to ca. 1400. 117 Between ff. I 13 and 114, i.e. between Rev. II and ES, there is an unnumbered leaf without text. 118 He has also written out cod. IV. H. I o in Prague University Library; see Truhlif I, 314 (no. 774); Kraft, NTBB, 13, 157. As Kraft, loc. cit., has pointed out, this latter manuscript, which con- tains Rev. III—IV and SA, constitutes a continuation of y. There would seem also to have been a third concluding part of y containing at least Rev. V—VII. This part has apparently been lost. 119 On this rubric, found in Fb (see p. 206) and several other manuscripts, see p. 226. 120 See the crit. app. of this ed., pp. 229, I and 240, 209. 121 On this marginal note, referring to the opening words of the prologue (Stupor etc.), taken from Jer. 5, 3o and which also appears in other MSS., see p. 169 with footn. 16 and 17. 122 Cf. p. 38. 123 On Rubrica ... ante see p. 225, n. II. 124 371 has nothing about Decl. 116, but in the right margin at the end of the ch. y2 (= the rubricator) has entered Declaracionem require in fine secundi (!). Kraft, NTBB, 13, 161, n. 3, maintains that secundi is an error for sexti; this seems very plausible. Another possibility, however, is that the rubricator intended to enter Decl. I 16 on the blank leaf after Rev. II (in fine secundi). A similar reference is found at the end of ch. 16 in z; see p. 76. 115 116

However, there is no Decl. entered in the stated place. Moreover there is an unnumbered leaf without text after Rev. H. ff. 114r-13 I': ES (8 chs. with text rubrics). ff. 131v-19e: Rev VIII (with text rubrics): . . . Explicit liber regum deo gracias per infinita secula seculorum. xXwv Within the y, manuscripts X w v, known as the Kropacz manuscripts,125 form a special group together with x. Common to these four manuscripts, amongst other things, are the following errors: 21, 33 ceteris (pre ceteris Ka W g deest j) om. x X w v; 22, 6 omnia (deest j) om. x X w v; 3o, 31 f. Et ille respondit : Adhuc semel misericordiam faciam propter to (propter preces tuasKa) om. x X w v (deest j); 7, 29 malles (uelis magis D Q h 1 s pocius z1- pocius velis z2 deest Z)] uelles x X w v; 1o, 97 post duceretur add. ducebatur x X w v; 16, 51 Respondit dyabolus (R. tunc d. Ka y Et tunc respondit et dixit z deest Z)] respondit tunc et dixit x X w v; 21, 48 corpore (deest j)] carne x X w v. These errors show that x X w v derive from the same source containing all these incorrect readings. In theory it is also possible that the errors stem from the oldest of these manuscripts, x, a possibility discussed in more detail below. x Xw—v Concerning the internal relations between x X w v it can be said with certainty that v, the latest manuscript, was not copied from any of the other three as these have several common errors not found in v; for example, 21, 6o magis (post michi) om. x X W; 22, 13 spiritus eorum om. x X W; 23, 14 caro om. X X W; 25, 21 f. Longa enim est pena eterna. Ideo propter maximam caritatem (post caritatem) propter homoeoteleuton om. x X w. X — In X and w we find a large number of errors which indicate the close relation- ship between the two manuscripts. Because of the numerous omissions in them we can conclude that neither of them has been the original of any other known manuscript. Amongst their common errors are the following: 1, 62 verbum] dictum X w; 2, 18 morte om. X w; 5, 58 Et si est om. X w; 6, 29 timeant] timebunt X w. A remarkable number of the errors common to X w can be explained as errores propter homoeoteleuton, e. g. 8, 12 f. venisti ...membrorum (VI verba post membrorum) om. X w; 1o, 62 f. sine ... peperi eum (VI verba post peperi eum) om. X w; 1o, 162 f. se ... modicum (XVI verba post modicum) om. X vir, 16, 22 f. sunt . . . qui (VII verba post qui) om. X w. The number of this type of error in X w is, however, so great that it seems difficult to believe that a 11 of these have arisen independently in the two manuscripts. A more probable explanation for their presence in X w is that they—or most of them—were already found in an 125 See above, pp. 64-71. 
 
 
 
 
 79 original common to X w or that they were copied from X (the older manuscript) into w. I have not found any conclusive proof that X was not the original from which w was copied. There is, however, at least one omission in X which points to the conclusion that w was not copied from X.126 In Rev. i o, 121 W, like most of the other manuscripts, has preserved the correct reading sororium meum. In X1 (as indeed also in R), there is only meum but the scribe has left a gap before this word and another hand (X2) has since filled in consobrinum (cf. 35: 2 where this same Johannes is mentioned as being frater consobrinus); La has sororium uel consobrinum, so-called "Doppellesarten",127 whilst y2 (deest f) has socium meum.128 The correct reading in w can naturally also be explained as a conjecture made by the scribe of w, possibly after consultation of some other manuscript. However, I am more inclined to think that the word sororium was found in an original common to X and w but written in such a way that the scribe of X was unable to decipher it and was therefore forced to leave a gap in the text. There are other places in the text indicating that x X w reproduce an original at times hardly legible or corrupt; for example, 18, 42 where X and x1 have a gap instead of religio (religij y); in w we find sancta Ecclesia, which is presumably w's own con- jecture; x2 has religio (in lacuna) uel ecclesia (in marg.); 27, 41 de loco] de delfico phibico (vel phibito) x de dolfico phibico X de dolfico prohibito w delphito La spatio vacuo relicto om. Ka v. That the text is corrupt here has been marked by a cross in the margin (t) in w and La. Among the yi manuscripts it is only y2 Z z that have retained the correct reading.129 Also in y delfico (y1) seems to have been the original reading which has, however, been corrected by y2; the meaningless phibico in x X, which has been "improved" to prohibito in w, may be explained as a corruption arisen through anticipation of the following modicum. x —X w Since, as has already been exemplified, x X w show a number of common errors compared to the other manuscripts, we may ask the question: Can x have been the immediate original of the two younger manuscripts X and w? Before I attempt to answer this question I would like to illustrate further the close relation- ship between these three manuscripts with additional examples: 48, 62 f. inutile ... erant (XV verba post erat) om. x X w (deest v); 2, 17 secreta] omnia secreta x X w; de 15, 47 considerata] considerata x desiderata X w 1‘41) deconsiderata v. In this latter place the context requires considerata. Thus the reading desiderata is in- correct. As is seen, x vacillates between considerata and desiderata (de is written 126 It is worth pointing out that both in Rev. VII and in SA X has certain errores separativi com- pared to w; see Bergh 28-32, 107; Eklund—Leby 35, 22. 127 Cf. p. 8o, n. i3o; Josephson 64-77- '28 Bb has filium sororis mee; see below, pp. 202, 213. 129 Among other sections of the text the defective cod. j lacks the whole of chs. 18 and 27; see above, p. 72. 
 
 
 
 
 So above 9 [—con] in considerata, entered by the same hand). If these manuscripts had been copied from x, the reading desiderata in X w would mean that the two scribes have interpreted de as a correction of con. There is, however, another pos- sible explanation. The original of x had considerata but written in such a way that the abbreviation 9 ( = con) could also be interpreted as de. Uncertain as to which of these was meant, the scribe of x wrote out both the alternatives. Another scribe interpreted the same word in the same original as desiderata. From this transcription, a now lost twin manuscript of x, desiderata was transmitted into X and w. A contamination of the two readings is found in v: deconsiderata;130 15, 79 creatorem] saluatorem 20 in creatorem mut. x2 saluatorem creatorem X' and wl. Here the scribes of X and w do not seem to have observed the cor- rection in the original until they had already written the incorrect saluatorem; this was then crossed out, or possibly crossed out and erased, by the respective scribes. In view of this detail in the text x might easily be assumed to be the direct original of X and w, but the origin of the error may also be explained in another way. Let us suppose that in the original of x saluatorem was the reading of the actual text but creatorem was written either above the line or in the margin. x2 might well have understood this to be a correction, whereupon he changed saluatorem to creatorem. In the original of X and w, which in my opinion was a twin manu- script of x, the conditions may have been identical but the scribes of X and w considered creatorem primarily as a supplement, then as a correct variant added to replace saluatorem; 18, zo reputant] contempnunt (in reputant mut. x2) xl X w. If this correction in x had been done by the same hand at the same time as that in the former place (15, 79), the correct reading reputant would have been entered in X and w if x were their immediate original. That this was not the case is also indicated by other places in the text; e.g. 7, 5, where x alone of all manuscripts has me instead of te,131 and 34, 51 paterer om. x1 Xw darer x2. On the basis of the errors in the x X w v group pointed out here, the mutual 130 There are several examples of contaminated readings in the y manuscripts, for example, Prol. M., 144 et fideliter f3 fideliterque 7t (exc. X w) Gh et fideliterque X w (see above, p. 53); 5: 17 dicentes p F N Ba b quia dicunt 3 (exc. F N Ba b) quia dicentes dicunt y (see pp. 88 f.). A striking parallel to v's deconsiderata is found in a Vatican manuscript of Caesar's De bello Gallico in which de producere found in the original has given rise to prodeducere, which has later been corrected to deducere; see W. Hering, Die Recensio der Caesarhandschriften. Berlin, 1963, p. i o. 131 Regarding the textual tradition in Rev. VII Bergh 28 observes that in "X ... w x there are such a number of errors and of such a kind as to exclude that one of them has served as the original of the others." As evidence of this is quoted, for instance, Rev. VII 12: 42 parrochianos suos corripiant om. x. Unfortunately this piece of information, which is correct, has dropped out of the app. crit., p. 151. However, at the same time Bergh 3o stresses that on the basis of the text in Rev. VII it is impossible to determine "the relationships between X ... w x ... with any degree of cer- tainty." Cf. Bergh V, pp. 52 f., 61-63, 65 f. Neither does the text of SA clearly indicate the relation- ship between the manuscripts discussed: "the material from the SA is clearly in favour of taking x to be an antecedent of X w, but objections may be raised" (Eklund—Leby 36). 
 
 
 
 
 8i relationship of these manuscripts may be illustrated by the following stemma codicum:132 x X w v—z There are in z a number of errors it shares with x X w v and which indicate that these five manuscripts belong to the same branch of yi. The following errors are significant: 10, 104 cum eo om. x X w v 2;133 54, 10 f. Tercio (-a y) est mundus, ut (in y Z ita quodKa) nullum peccatum in eo inueniri (inueniri om. Ka) possit (potest Z) om. x X w v2 z Tercio est mundus v1 (lin. del. et exp. v2); 6, 18 in] ad x X w v z (1 deest Z); 10, 169 in] per x X w v z ad Ka (deest Z); 15, 73 viam (uitam R deest Z)] bonam viam x X w v z; 16, 27 Tunc] Et x X w v z (deest Z); 45, 78 facio] inpendo x X w v z. Since x X w v, as shown above, are marred by several common errors that must be assumed to have arisen from their common original but which do not appear in z, then neither can any of the manuscripts x X w v nor their common original have been the immediate source of z. We are forced to reckon with a common source for z and the common original of x X w v. This relationship can be illustrated by the following stemma:134 x On the basis of, amongst others, the following individual errors z (written 1407) cannot have been the original of any known, later manuscript of the Revelations: 7, 14 tua ... tunica (VIII verba post Tunica) om. z (deest Z); 9, verentur (vene- rentur n om. z (deest Z). As a result of the last-mentioned omission z2 has been forced to cross out et before timent in the same sentence. Another alteration by z2 is found in 7, 29; see above, p. 78. xXwvz—Ka The relationships of Ka are more difficult to determine. However, what is certain is that this undated manuscript cannot have been the original of any other manuscript examined. For the fact is that it has numerous omissions compared 1 " Cf. Bergh 32, Bergh V, p. 66, and Eklund—Leby 22, 49-52. The defective cod. Z lacks, amongst other sections, the whole of ch. 1o; see pp. 72 f.; Ta Cb omit i o, 104 Cumque venissem cum eo ad locum passionis; cf. pp. 141, 2 14. 134 Cf. Bergh 28-32; Bergh V, pp. 52 f., 61-66; Eklund—Leby 22, 36-40, 49-53. '" 8 — 774372 
 
 
 
 
 82 to the other manuscripts; for example, Prol. M., 5 f. hominis, audiunt, ut olim Helias in sibilo aure tenuis audiuit. Qui om. Ka;135 Rev. 3, 14 multi om. Ka; 8, 8 f. creator (om. yi T') ... Deus (XIV verba post Deus) om. Ka; 31, 34 f. eiusdem omni (VIII verba) om. Ka (deest j).136 Equally certain is that Ka cannot have been copied from any of the manuscripts x X w v z all of which have common and individual errors compared to Ka.137 Are there no errors uniting Ka and x X w v z? There is. These manuscripts have at least o n e common omission, namely 9, 51 sequi om. x X w v z Ka (deest Z). Of the yi manuscripts it is, as seen, only j La y that have main- tained the correct reading. A few other errors may be noted here: 5, 13 Qui] aut xX w v Kay At z "psi autem jLa y, Et illi W g deest Z. The origin of this error (aut), which may have already been found in the y hyparchetype, is easy to under- stand from a palaeographic point of view: the letters Q and a, respectively i and t could, because of their similarity not least in Gothic cursive script, easily be con- fused. Such a confusion has probably occurred in this case. In j La y, an attempt has been made to correct the error, obviously without consulting any manuscript outside y.138 Further: 5, 45 habent] autem x X w Ka autem habent b enim habent y, reputant La deest Z. This error is also easily explained paleographically: the hit (= habent) of the original has been misinterpreted by some scribe as aid (= autem). Of the yl manuscripts only v zj y have maintained the original and correct reading. Since I have not found any error linking Ka more closely to any other manu- scripts than to x X w v z I consider it probable that Ka belongs to the same branch of the y1 tradition as these five manuscripts. Its place in the stemma can therefore be assumed to be the following: y Z La The examination of the yl manuscripts hitherto carried out has shown that x X w v z and Ka on the basis of a number of common errors can be assumed to represent the same branch of the yl tradition. The other y, manuscripts, y Z j La, are not combined to form a homogeneous group based on common errors. 135 tit . . . audiuit (post audiunt) om z. As mentioned above (pp. 72 f.), the whole of Prol. M. and Rev. I 1-21: 2 Ego is missing in Z. 136 Of the individual readings found in Ka may be mentioned i, 53 deo instead of corde and 3o, 32 preces tuas instead of to (see above, p. 78). 137 See above, pp. 78-81. 138 Cf. below, pp. 83-85,223. 
 
 
 
 
 83 Characteristic of them is instead, as should already be obvious, that to a greater extent than the other y, manuscripts they seem to have maintained the original, correct readings. In spite of positive evidence (cf. p. 143), I have assigned them to a common branch of the text tradition and one in a somewhat better state than that to which xXwvzKa belong.139 y Decidedly the best of all they manuscripts I have examined for this edition is the undated cod. y which is surprisingly free from individual errors. Its text would therefore seem best to reflect the y, hyparchetype. Of the individual errors in y the following are worth mentioning: 16, 3o uirga mea instead of virgo Maria (virgo mater La y, ipsa Virgo maria j deest Z); 23, 74 cum] in (deest j) B y exc. y140 om. y; 41, 109 visionem] faciem (deest j) y exc. y om. y. On the basis of these errors and what has come to light concerning y's relations with the other manuscripts, I do not think it probable that y served as the direct original of any of the other y manu- scripts. Z j La—y That y cannot have been copied from any of the manuscripts XXWVZKa is quite clear as these latter manuscripts, as shown above, contain numerous errors both common and individual compared to y. Neither can Z j La have been the original of y as these contain certain errores separativi compared to y; for example, 23, 28 f. hominibus placeat (X verba post placeat) om. Z (deest j); 32, 6o f. quippe aliquibus (X verba post aliquibus) om. Z (deest j); 4, 40-42 Potest ... animas eorum (XXVI verba post eorum) om. j (deest Z); 32, 46 nec emendat om. La (deest j); 32, 81 per meam potenciam] per meam potestatem seu po- tenciam Fa ponam La (deest j). The cited omissions in Z also show that this manu- script (written in 1403) cannot have been the original of the later cod. La (written in 1406). That neither Z or La should even be considered as having been the original of the older cod. j (written in 1401) need hardly be pointed out.141 j —La That a close relationship exists between j and La is apparent from, for example, the following errors common to these two manuscripts: Prol. M., 45 princeps] pater j La; 83 pauperem] propter se pauperem j La; 104 regnans (regens T1 existens et regnans A)] residens j La; Rev. 3, 15 et diligunt (post vanitatem T1 et eras. T2) om. j La. The question is: Can La be assumed to have been copied from the five years ," Cf. Bergh 28-32; Bergh V, pp. 52 f., 61-63, 65 f.; Eklund—Leby 22, 37 f., 49-52. The variant reading in in place of cum may have arisen from a confusion of cu (= cum) and in in the respective originals; cf. Rev. 17, 24; 21, 71 (in the crit. app.). 141 Kraft has (NTBB, 13, 158, n. 2) although "with all reservations" put forward the hypothesis that Z is a transcription of the three-year older cod. v. This hypothesis must, however, be discarded as incorrect, amongst other reasons because of the above-mentioned omissions and other errors in v (and certain other manuscripts) compared to Z; see above, pp. 78, 81 (Rev. 30, 31 f.; 45, 78), 79 (Rev. 27, 41), 81 (Rev. 54, 10 f.); 73. 140 
 
 
 
 
 84 older j ? Such a relation cannot exist since j contains several errores separativi com- pared to La; for example, I, 32 contra om. j; I, 39 f. Qui ... visitabo (VII verba) om. j; 4, 40-42 Potest ... animas eorum om. j (see above, p. 83). Probably j and La are twin manuscripts deriving from a common, now lost, original. The examination of the yi manuscripts now completed has shown that the yl tradition divides into two main branches and that the manuscripts are divided according to the following stemma: x W j La — T (y0 The observant reader has already noticed that j La and T (n) share incorrect readings in two passages quoted above.142 The close connection of T, and con- sequently also of 12, with j La can be illustrated by more examples of errors com- mon to these manuscripts, such as: 1, 9 peccato et] peccati j La Ti; I, 55 ita om. j La Tl; 4, 33 ego (ergo Pa enim q') om. j La Ti; 4, 34 demoni (demonio d)] demoni- bus j La T M2; 31, 46 et pulchritudo om. La Ti (deest j); 32, 71 exit (exiet Fa Pa)] eicitur La T (deest j). It appears then that in several cases T2 has corrected the erroneous text. I consider it very probable that this was done in connection with the entry of the so-called supplementary material in the manuscript.143 The a manuscript from which the declaraciones of T were copied would thus seem also to have been used as an emendatory exemplar by T2 . That T and its original, the y2 hyparchetype, have been influenced by 8 not only in respect of the declara- ciones, is obvious, as will appear from the following investigation;144 in other words, the y2 manuscripts are contaminated. The established relationship between j La T is not of such a nature that j or La can be taken as having been the original of the younger cod. T. Such a relation- ship is out of the question as j and La contain both individual and common errores separativi to T.145 Consequently we can also conclude that the presumptive original of j and La cannot have been the original of T. As far as I can see, T would seem to derive directly from the 12 hyparchetype, the primary source of which seems 142 See above, pp. 6z f.

The investigation of the y manuscripts has led to the following stemma codi- cum:146 Ka .1 La Y2 w T t Ea f 2. The 3 group In about 2/3 of the 1r manuscripts certain chapters in Rev. I are provided with declaraciones.1 As I have shown earlier, this type of supplementary material was first entered in Vadstena MSS. in 1380,2 whence it was—directly or indirectly— handed down in other manuscripts. These manuscripts, representing what is termed the Vadstena redaction of the Revelations,3 I call the a group. The presence of declaraciones is, however, not the only characteristic of these manuscripts. As I shall show and as I have already suggested,4 it is clear that the original revelation text has not only been increased by supplementary material in these manuscripts, but has also been subject to certain revisions in point of language. Thus the textual recen- sion found in the 3 manuscripts has probably been drafted in Vadstena Cloister, where the now lost 3 hyparchetype was surely once to be found.5 In the a group belong the following manuscripts: DFKMNQSWBaDa Cf. Bergh 22-32; Bergh V, p. 66; Eklund—Leby 22, 34-40, 49-53. 1 For more details see pp. 28 ff., 52 f., 217-224; through a secondary influence from some 8 manuscript certain decl. have been entered into the f3 manuscript L and in the y2 manuscripts T t Ea; see pp. 52 f., 58 ff., 217 f. 2 See pp. 28 ff. 3 See pp. 3o f. 4 See pp. 29-31. 8 Cf.

 86 Gab Ha7 ja pa Ta Uas 1V1 mb b g h 1 q s.9 Amongst other faults there are the following erroneous, or probably erroneous, readings in these MSS.: Rev. 29, i8 ille diabolus (diabolus ille o dyabolus Cl p y, (deest j) Tl M2 (dyabolus in m. M2 eras. Ms): ille (deest Ga Ha Ua q f om. 1 s) T2 t Ea Gh. The reading ille diabolus common to the f3 and y hyparchetypes is probably identical with that of the archetype. The absence of diabolus in a is probably due to a conscious "emendation" in the a hyparchetype, possibly resulting from the emendator's—perfectly understandable —difficulty in identifying ille diabolus with Serue meus (29, z o). In the revelation Mary tells Birgitta that there are two mistresses, Mistress Humility (domina Humilitas) and Mistress Arrogance (domina Superbia). The latter is governed by ipse diabolus who is her dominus.10 This same devil is described by Mary as Mistress Arrogance's "knight" (miles suus) and is addressed by Mistress Arrogance as "my servant" (Serue meus).11 Thus one and the same person is called in this revelation "devil", "knight", "master" and "servant" which may have been too much for the emendator to handle at once. In the Old Swedish version ille diabolus and ille correspond to "Riddarin" ( = the knight).12 Since the Old Swedish text usually follows the text handed down in 3, "Riddarin" should rather be considered as a translation and elucidation of ille since it is not clear to what it refers. We cannot of course entirely preclude the possibility that ille was also found in the archetype. If this was the case, diabolus could be explained as an elucidatory supplement entered in the margins of the p and y hyparchetypes and included in the text in later transcriptions. In this way f3 and y may have been provided with the reading ille diabolus quite independently of each other. I would now like to call attention to another passage of the text where a also seems to give an erroneous reading, namely, Rev. 37: 5. Mary laments to Birgitta that by their vices and sins Christ's enemies at this time subject him to a more bitter crucification spiritually than the Jews did when they crucified him physi- cally: nunc conqueror, quod filius meus ab inimicis suis, qui nunc sunt in mundo, amarius crucifigitur quam tunc Iudei crucifixerunt eum. Nam licet dic as, quod imp as sibilis sit nec mori possit, tamen cum propriis viciis crucifigunt eum. In place of dicas, quod, which we find handed down in p y1 (om. X w deest j) T1 , 3 T2 Ea have deitas (diuinitas ja t deest Ga. Ha Ua f q). Neither is the reading impassibilis handed down uniformly; it is found in about half of the 33 manuscripts (Aa2 a B C c2 d e Fa H I 0a2 V Y2), in a (deest Ga. W Ua q), in one y, manuscript (z) and in y, (T2 t Ea deest f). The rest of the p manuscripts (A Aa1 c1 E J L 0 0a1 o P 6 Contains only Prol. M., the text of which shows, however, certain errors typical of the 3 manu- scripts; see pp. 126 f., 143. 7 Lacks decl. but the fragmentary text is 8 in character; see pp. 128, 139-141. 8 Of Rev.

 87 R Sa V), four yi manuscripts (Ka La x Z om. X w deest j) and T1 have impossibile, while m v y have impassibi/e.12 That impassibilis is correct need not be questioned. The question is whether dicas, quod or deitas was found in the archetype. In the former case impassibilis is the adjunct to filius meus, in the latter to deitas. Both these alternatives are ob- viously possible from a theological-dogmatic point of view and can further be supported with parallels from the Revelations. Concerning Christ's impassibility or passibility, as is well-known, the Lateran synod of 1215 had declared: Iesus Christus ... cum secundum divinitatem sit immortal's et imp assibilis, idemque ipse secundum humanitatem factus est passibilis et mortalis.14 This declaration may be compared with the following passages in the Revelations where the adjective im- passibilis also refers to Christ: Rev. V 13: 20 (God to Birgitta): Tercius locus est Caluarie, vbi filius meus vulneratus et mortuus est secundum humanitatem, sed secundum deitatem impassibilis et immortalis erat; VI 19 E (Christ to Birgitta:) Quis est autem dolor iste, quem facit michi homo, cum ... impassibilis sim, in eternum manens Deus?; VIII 48 G (ex.) ille, qui est ex se imp as sibilis et ex humani- tate factus est passibilis et qui mortalitate assumpta promeruit homini immortalita- tern ... We find impassibilis as adjunct to deitas in, for instance, the following revelations: Rev. IV 132 C (in.; Christ to Birgitta:) Isti (sc. mali sacerdotes) autem in prelo ponunt me et premunt fortiter. Sed potes querere, quomodo, cum deitas mea imp assibilis est ... VI I I A (Mary to Birgitta:) deitas jn ilia horula mortis tamquam compaciens videbatur, licet nullum dolorem vel penam deitas pati possit, quia impassibilis ... est. Concerning impassibilis cf. TLL, VII: 1, 522, 43 ff. Even if impassibilis is used in the Revelations as an adjunct to Iesus Christus (filius meus) as well as to deitas I find it difficult from a linguistic and stylistic point of view to accept the 3 reading deitas as the original and correct one in the text under discussion. It seems to me that eum after crucifigunt requires the same head-word to refer back to as eum after crucifixerunt; namely, filius meus. This requirement is fulfilled if one chooses the reading dicas, quod. Regarding dicas (you = Birgitta) cf. 37: 7 potes querere (see also 26: 8; 32: 12; 39: 3; 47: 14; etc.), 22: 5 Sed dices forte ...; concerning dicere, quod (with ind. or conj.) cf. e.g. 4: 8; io: 24. There may be various different theories as to the origin of the reading deitas. I suspect that it originated mechanically. The scribe who wrote the a hyp- archetype may have understood the dicas of his original as ditas (= deitas), palaeo- graphically a very easy misunderstanding. The succeeding impassibilis, which is a frequent adjective with deitas, may have contributed to the misinterpre- tation. How then is the loss of quod in a to be explained? It may possibly be a question of a conscious emendation carried out in the a hyparchetype, whose deitas does not allow quod. However, it is not unlikely that quod has disappeared 13 14 So also Abe after the correction of impossibile (Abi); cf. p. 21 I. Denzinger-Rahner 429, pp. 199 f. 
 
 
 
 
 88 mechanically. If we assume that in the original of the a hyparchetype the common abbreviation of quod (q) was used and that imp in the immediately succeeding impassibilis was written ip, the omission of the former may be explained by haplo- graphy. Several 8 readings can be characterized as grammatical normalizations or clarifica- tions of facts. To the first category I would assign, for example, Prol. M.: 25 Nedum existimare queam, omnes hoc auditor es (p [deest I 0] y, [deest Z v] F N Ga Gh audituros a [exc. F N Ba Ga audientes Ba deest Ha ua Mb] 12 [deest f]) credere posse, qui verba non audierunt et opera nescierunt. In my opinion the reason why the original and fully acceptable reading auditores was changed to audituros in 3 (whence it can be assumed to have found its way into y2)14a may have been that the emendator found the use of the verbal noun auditores with the acc. obj. strange (hoc is at the same time the acc. obj. of the succeeding credere). It is true that I have not found any parallel to this use of nomina agentis either in Prol. M. or in the Rev., but parallels can be found in other Middle Latin—and Late Latin—texts.15 Whether we interpret auditores16 as = audituros or as audientes (as in Ba) or, which is plausible, as = qui audient (audiant), the passage in question should be translated: "Even less would I expect that everyone hearing this, who has not heard the words and has not been made aware of the deeds, should be able to believe it." As we see, the reading auditores has also been preserved in 3 a manuscripts, F N Ga, and in Gh (as well as in the later editions). I find it particularly note- worthy that the Vadstena manuscript F here and in several other cases—usually together with the younger a manuscripts Ba and b—diverges from the 8 tradition and shows the same readings as p.1? This indicates that F reproduces an original whose text has not been deprived of its f character to such an extent as the final a hyparchetype. An illustration of this is found in Rev. 5: 17, where most a manu- scripts produce a grammatically standardized text. Christ complains to Birgitta that many people do not care that he suffered death on the cross for their sakes and says: Vexillum18 meumprosternitur et conculcatur (prosternunt et conculcant N Mb Gh cett. edd.), dicentes (ii [deest I] F N Ba Mb b Gh cett. edd. quia dicunt a exc. F N Ba Mb b [deest Ga Ha Ua] quia dicentes dicunt r [deest Z f]): `Quare passus est? Quid prodest nobis? ...' The grammatically incorrect use of dicentes in p has, as is seen, given rise to certain emendations. In order to be able to retain dicentes as participium conciunctum the passive construction has been changed to active in N19 Mb and Gh. In 8 the passive construction has been kept but the participle 14a See p. 58, n. 53. See Bassols I, 543 f.; Bastardas Parera 36 f.; H-Sz 34 (with further ref.); cf. ib., 387. 16 Probably by auditores Mathias primarily means those who by reading his Prologue and cohering revelation hear of Birgitta's words and deeds for the first time; cf. Prol. M.: 6 Nec suspicio ulla fallacis spiritus mentibus ista leg encium obrepat. As for auditor=qui legit, cf. MW, I, 1197, 28 ff. 17 See pp. 143 ff.; 219 f. 19 Vexillum is here used as a symbol of passio Christi; see the app. sim. ad loc. 19 On this heavily interpolated manuscript see pp. 118-12o. 15 
 
 
 
 
 89 (dicentes) has been replaced by a causal clause (quia dicunt).20 In y, the p and a readings are contaminated (quia dicentes dicunt). The text handed down in p and some 8 manuscripts, Vexillum meum prosternitur et conculcatur, dicentes, is in my opinion the original one and identical with that of the archetype. The clause can be regarded as anacoluthic.21 The initially passive construction continues and ends as if it were active.22 It must be assumed that confusion between the two following constructions has arisen: V. m. prosternitur et conculcatur ab iis, dicentibus resp. V. m. prosternunt et conculcant, dicentes (as in N Mb Gh and the other editions). A striking parallel to this section of text is found in Rev. 44:R Verba creatoris qualiter nunc despicitur et vituperatur ab hominibus, non attendentes nec curantes. As one would expect, this section also has been subjected to gram- matical corrections in certain manuscripts. Thus attendentes has been replaced in Fl K Mb and Gh by attendentibus, in p2 F2 and Ba by attendendo, in q2 by qui ... attendunt and by nec attendunt in N, while curantes has been changed to curantibus in A* S* Mb and Gh and to nec curant in N. Such incongruity between the present participle and the head word can be observed in several places in the Revelations; for example, Rev. 48, 34 where most manuscripts and Gh have displicuit eis, quod eduxerit eos de captivitate, dicentes (instead of the expected dicentibus). The participle dicentes has been replaced in K by et dixerunt and in W g by ideo dicebant. The construction in Rev. 48, 34 can be explained as a contamination of displicuit eis dicentibus and—possibly—murmuraverunt dicentes (cf. Vulg. num. 14, 2). The grammatically incorrect, freer use of the present participle in the nominative— especially of what is termed "erstarrtes dicens (dicentes)" introducing direct speech is by no means an unusual phenomenon in Christian Latin authors; see H-Sz 389 f. (with further ref.), where amongst others the following example is cited: Epiphan. in euang. '58, 22 ut nulla sit eis in die iudicii excusatio, dicentes : Cf. Erikson, Sprachl. Bemerk., 67 f.; Blaise, Manuel, § 364; Mohrmann, Etudes, 12, 415 f.; Plater-White 19. My own view on the divergent readings in Rev. s: 17 is the following: dicentes was found in the archetype and handed down correctly in f3 and some a manu- scripts. This grammatically unsatisfactory reading was corrected in 7r, the common hyparchetype of y and 8, to quia dicunt. These two words may have been written above dicentes or in the margin. This correction was correctly interpreted by the scribe responsible for the 3 hyparchetype, whereas the y hyparchetype scribe mis- understood it and entered double readings (quia dicentes dicunt). We find another example of grammatical standardization in Rev. 34, 63, where all the .3 manuscripts (deest Ha Ua q) except W b g have potenciorem omnibus in- 20 The Old Swedish translation of this passage seems to have been done from a Latin original belonging to the 8 tradition: Mit baner nidhir slas ok vndir fotir trudz, thy at the sighia (BU, I, 16, I I).

 90 stead of potenciorem (potentem Sa) pre (supra R super Sa) omnibus. The latter, un- classical construction — prepositional expression instead of pure abl. compara- tionis23—is to be found in (3 and y (deest j v) as well as in one a manuscript, b, whilst the two heavily interpolated 3 manuscripts W and g24 have replaced potencior em (pre) omnibus by omnipotentem. Gh and the later editions here, as in most other cases, follow the text handed down in 3. Certain 3 readings appear to be clarifications or explanations that seem originally to have been entered as marginal glosses in the a hyparchetype whence they have been copied by mistake into the text itself25 in most 3 manuscripts. This is the ex- planation I would offer, for example, in the case of 31: I where Birgitta is stated as having seen the Queen of Heaven, Mary, clothed in a mantellum de azuro26 seu sereni celi coloris, "a mantle of azure or the colour of the clear blue sky", i.e. a mantle of heavenly blue.27 The reading de azuro, in my opinion the original and correct one, is to be found in most p manuscripts; namely B E I J L O P R V Y AaSa (azurro) a c1 ( ?) e o, in two y MSS., v y, as well as in one a MS., W (as-). The remaining (3 and y manuscripts have instead of de azuro: de azurio m de azoto A de lazuro z de lasuro Ka de auro CH Fa Oa c2 dTI-XZ La w X. The majority of the a manuscripts plus y2 and Gh have on the other hand blaueum (-ium b t -em Ea) de az u r o (D F K Ql -io h E" as- b lazuro Q2 Da Ja Pa lasuro M2 lazurio T2 Ea2 t lasurio is auro M1 ST1)DFKMQSDa Ja Pa Mbbhis T2 Ea t Gh;28 NW Ta g only give blaueum, while Ga Ha Ua fj q lack this passage in the text.29 The numerous variants of azuro indicate that some copyists were un- certain about both the spelling and meaning of the word azurum.30 The very fact 22 Several examples of this phenomenon in the Rev. are listed in my Glossarium, p. 466, s.v. pre 2) B, and in the Index rerum, p. 5o6, s.v. Ablativus comparationis (with further ref.). A contributory reason why the fairly common pre construction in the Rev. has here been replaced in 8 by a pure abl. comp. may have been the emendator's endeavour at stylistic elegance: the immediately succeed- ing sentence (Rev. 34, 63) to (abl. comp.) potencior corresponds to potenciorem omnibus. 24 See below, pp. 123, 132, 138 f., 222. 25 Cf. West 22 f., 28, 58, 113, 125 f. 26 Of linguistic interest is the use of de azuro instead of the qualitative genitive azuri without an attribute. See H-Sz 7o f.; cf. Bassols I, § 109; Bastardas Parera § 22; Blaise, Manuel, § 85; K. Nyrop, Grammaire historique de la langue francaise, 6 (Copenhague, 193o), pp. 1 o 1 f. 27 On blue in the Christian colour symbolism see e.g. G. Haupt, Die Farbensymbolik in der sakrakn Kunst des abendliindischen Mittelalters. Diss., Leipzig, 1940 (print. in Dresden, 1941), pp. 99-107; cf. LTK, 4, 23, s.v. Farben; RAC, 7, 358-447 (spec. 416), s.v. Farbe. 28 From and including the Nuremberg ed. of 1517 the Latin editions read lazuro instead of azuro; cf. Hollman 20 ff.; above, p. 4- 29 See pp. 126-128, 113 f., 6o f., 71 f., 135 f. so The noun azur(um) is of Arabic-Persian origin, probably arising in the Romance languages through deglutination of *liizeird (1 was understood as being the definite article), a vulgar Arabic variant of liizaward which derives from the Persian lithvard= lapis lazuli. Lapis lazuli was first mined in Persia whence it came to the West during the Middle Ages, apparently first to Italy. Because of its colour the name of the stone also came to mean 'the colour of the sky'. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese azzurro (it appears as a noun as early as Dante) and azul (found in a Spanish document from 944), respectively, became the general word for 'blue', whilst azur in French (appears as a noun 
 
 
 
 
 9 that de azuro must be explained by—the unanimously handed down—seu sereni celi colons in the text shows that azurum ( = 'azure', 'heavenly blue') cannot have been a particularly common word at the end of the B oo's when the Revelations began to be widely spread and known in Europe.31 What is certain is that no in- stance of azur(um) has been found earlier in Swedish Middle Latin or Old Swed- ish.32 For this reason I think it highly probable that the word blaueum33 which was more comprehensible to a Medieval Swede was entered as an explanation of de azuro in the a hyparchetype, in my opinion drafted in Vadstena.34 It also seems reasonable to assume that Swede, which was entered after regno in Prol. M., i 8 i into all a manuscripts except F N Ba G"5 and—via a secondary influence from 3—into T2 t Ea (deest f), is an explanatory addition.36 The word in Chanson de Roland) and Provençal is used to denote a special shade of blue, the colour of a clear blue sky. The common word for blue in French during the Middle Ages and onwards was bleu which, as is well known, is a word of Germanic (Frankish) origin; see Battaglia I, 917, s.v. Azzurro (cf. ib., VIII, 765, s.v. Lapislazzuli); Corominas I, 353 f., s.v. azul; FEW, 19 (1968), 107 f., s.v. laiward; ib., 1, 398-401, s.v. blao; cf. Tresor de la langue franfaise. Dictionnaire de la langue du XIX' et du XXe siecle (1789-1960) publie sous la direction de Paul Imbs, III (Paris, 1974), pp. 1164 f., s.v. azur; The Oxford English Dictionary, I, 6o3, s.v. Azure; 942 ff., s.v. Blue; Hellquist I, 38, s.v. azur; 82, s.v. bld. For the Germanic word b/tio in Old Swedish, cf. SOderwall I, 120 f., s.v. blar. Its usual Latinized forms are blavius and blaueus; instances have been found as early as the 8th century; see DuC, Hm, Lm, MW, Nr. The oldest known instance found in a Middle Latin document from Sweden is dated 1238 (DS, I, p. 293); see GMLS, I, 101, s.v. blaueus. As a noun meaning 'heavenly blue' the above-mentioned Persian-Arabic loan word is found in various Latinized forms as early as the 13th century: azurum, azurium, azurius, azulus etc., lazurum, lazurium, lazulum, lazulus etc.; see Blatt, NGl, s.v. lazulum; Lm; MW, I, 1298, s.v. azur. An instance of (l)azurum in this sense does not seem to have been found in Swedish Middle Latin before Birgitta's Rev. I 31: 1. In GMLS a reference is given from azurum to lazurum, under which title-word this very instance from Rev. I 31: I was intended to be given on the basis of the 1628 Rome edition, which has de lazuro; see GMLS, I, 101, s.v. blaueus; above footn. 28. (This according to information provided by the late editor of the dictionary, Dr. Ulla Westerbergh.) 31 See pp. 25 f. 32 In Soderwall I, 738, there is an example given of lasur = lapis lazuli, taken from a non-Bir- gittine text in Old Swedish (King Alexander) found in a manuscript of the 15th century; this lasur seems, however, to be a miswriting for lasar = laser, „der harzige Saft aus der Pflanze laserpicium" (Georges); see H. Ronge, Konung Alexander, pp. 231 f., 58 ff. The oldest examples of azur in Swedish derive from the 17th century. The word, which belongs to poetry and exalted style, is, as expected, often found in the neo-Romantics, not least in Stagnelius; see SAOB, 1, A 2777 ff., s.v. azur; cf. ib., 15, L 339 f., s.v. lasur. 33 See above, footn. 30. 34 See above, pp. 3o f., 85. The Old Swedish translation of the passage discussed here (Rev. I 31: i) runs: blan mantol ther war swa som bla skdr hymil j lytenom (BU, I, 94, 9 f.; see above p. 7, footn. o), i.e. 'blue mantle which was in colour like a clear blue sky'. According to codex Oxen- stiernus (=cod. Holm. A II o) from ca. 1385: blan mantol hauande sua som skdrs himins lit (Geete, Nio kapitel ur H. Birgittas uppenbarelser, p. 23, 2 f.; cf. Bergh V, p. 28, footn. 40; Kraft 21 ff., 25 ff.; Wessen, Svensk medeltid, 74 ff.), i.e. 'blue mantle being like the colour of the clear blue sky'. It appears that de azuro has no direct correspondent in these two Old Swedish translations, which probably were principally done for those members of Vadstena Cloister who were ignorant of Latin. 35 Prol. M. is missing in the 8 manuscripts Ha Ua Mb; see below, pp. 128, 113 f., 115. 86 See above, p. 58, n. 53.

This manuscript is one of the most precious treasures of Lund University Library. It was donated to the library in 1778 by the then chancellor, Councillor of the Realm, Count Melker Falkenberg. It is usually called "Codex Falkenberg" after the donor.38 Since 1956 it has been available in a facsimile edition edited by Prof. Elias Wessen in CCSMA, XIII—XIV (1952, 1956). In the introduction to this edition Wessell has given an excellent description of the appearance, contents and history of the manuscript.39 Along with K, F is the most complete Revelation manuscript from Vadstena Cloister preserved to our time. It was written down by Brother Johannes Johannis of Kalmar (t 1446)40 according to the Explicit after Rev. VIII, f. 3I4va: Explicit liber octauus. Finito libro sit laus et gloria christo.41 Conscriptus per manus fratris 37 The entry of Swecie in the text may also be due to influence from regno Swecie mentioned a few lines earlier in Prol. M., 178. In that case the error may have arisen independently in the above-mentioned 8 manuscripts. This explanation, however, seems less feasible to me. Cf. Prol. M., 207, where Gh and the other editions as well as C W Da rbdg have Swecie entered after regno.

 93 johannis johannis kalmarnensis. Orate pro eo.42 Unfortunately there is nothing in the MS. to indicate when it was written. Since the scribe calls himself frater in the above-cited Explicit, the manuscript cannot, according to Wessen XXVI, XLVI f., have been written before 1404, in which year Johannes was ordained a deacon of the cloister.43 On the other hand, the forceful and regular handwriting shows, in Wessen's opinion, that the manuscript in all certainty has not come into being after 1420 when Johannes Johannis was an old man (ca. 58 years old).44 The latter argument can, in my opinion, not be accorded any value as evidence. The fact that the scribe was 58 is not in itself any evidence that his handwriting must have changed to that of a shaky old man. Neither, as Bergh 61 quite correct- ly points out, can the fact that Johannes calls himself frater be taken as evidence that the manuscript came into being at the earliest in 1404, since as early as 1402 Johannes was called frater in another document45 which Wessen quotes himself (pp. XXV, XLVI). There are, however, other factors that should be considered in dating F. Of special importance is the arrangement of the supplementary material (addiciones, declaraciones, extrauagantes etc.) in the manuscript. These additions, which were missing from the so-called Alfonso editions of the Revelations, have been entered in several different places in the manuscript. The internal order of the appended passages has been marked with Roman numerals. Outside this numbering, which covers 147 passages, there are a smaller number of un- numbered supplements.46 Diderichsen, who concentrates his investigation on the addiciones and declara- ciones in F and K, maintains that this supplementary material would not have been entered in such disorder in F at a time when such supplements had already been given a fixed disposition, characteristic of succeeding redactions, in at least two other manuscripts; namely in the Vadstena manuscript K, according to the above scholar written about 1390, and in M, written in 1394. Thus he draws the conclusion Cf. f. 268rb, at the bottom, Et sic est finis harum reuelacionum. Deo gracias orate pro scriptore This event is mentioned in Diarium Watzstenense (CCSMA, XVI, p. 35; SRS, I: I , p. 117) in the following words: ipso die corporis christi videlicet in crastino translacionis beate birgitte ingressus est dominus iohannes iohannis calmarnensis consecratus per dominum kanutum episcopum Uncopensem in statum cNaconorum. It is not known when Johannes first became connected with Vadstena Cloister. At his death in 1446 he was stated in the diary as being 84 years old. This implies that he was born around 1362. The fact that Johannes was not mentioned in the diary before he was ordained a deacon in 1404 does not preclude the possibility that he had been a member of the Birgittine order as a frater of another kind. According to RS 12 and 13 the total number of brothers in the cloister was supposed to be 25, of which 13 were to be priests, 4 deacons and 8 lay-brothers. According to RS 22 none of these was permitted to take the monastic vow before his 25th year. As far as Johannes is concerned this could not have been before 1387. 44 For similar reasons Collijn, Birgittautstallningen, 127, dates the manuscript to around 1420 "Since the handwriting is forceful and does not show an aged man's hand." 45 Svenskt Diplomatarium (New Series, i , Stockholm, 1875-1884), no. 258, P. 193; cf. Norborg 278f. 46 On the supplementary material in F see Hollman 3o ff., 5o f.; Bergh 61, 7o ff.; Bergh V 72 f. 42 43 
 
 
 
 
 94 that F must be older than K (he dates it to around i 3 90).47 I share this opinion and as further support for Diderichsen's argument I would draw attention to the fact that the order of the supplementary material and the text of the Revelations that distinguishes K and M is already found in the oldest dated Revelation manu- script now known, Fb, from the year 1386 (see pp. 204-209). As Diderichsen 243 f. has already pointed out, text rubrics" only to Rev. I, V, VI 1-37 and the so-called papal revelations (ff. 171vb-177ra) are entered in F,49 whereas K has such rubrics written out in all the books. Diderichsen considers that this also adds to the evidence for the history of the text, thus indicating that F gives an older text stage than K.59 As regards Rev. I in F the following is worth pointing out. All the chapters are, as stated above, given text rubrics. By mistake the scribe has entered the text of ch. 3 after the rubric to ch. 2 and the text of ch. 2 after the rubric to ch. 3. The mistake has later been amended by references (a, B) in the margins. All seven Decl. are found, 6 of which are included in the so-called F numeration as nos. XLI— XLVI.51 Three Decl. each appear in two different versions. Regarding the supple- ments in Rev. I the following details are relevant: Decl. 3 (§§ 8-9: Iste sermone) is entered in the lower margin of f. 4v after an insertion sign referring to the end of ch. 3. It is marked as declaracio, but is not included in the F-numeration.52 47 See Diderichsen 243 ff., passim; respecting my dating of K see pp. 112 f. Regarding the dating of F other scholars have stated that the manuscript originates from the beginning or else the first half of the 1400's; see Godel 21; Hollman 5o; Kraft 71, n. I to p. 7o; Westman 267. Bergh, who has not taken a definite position as regards the dating of the manuscript, seems inclined to share Diderichsen's opinion; see Bergh 6o f. resp. Bergh V 7: "saec. XIV ex. ?". 48 There is no list of rubrics; see p. 225. 49 Cf. Wessen XIII—XV, XXXIII—XXXV who, on pp. XIII and XXXIII, against his better judgement, states that text rubrics are only found in "Lib. 1". 5° According to Diderichsen 243, n. I, the remarkable placing of the rubrics in F is due to the scribe of F having two different exemplars, one with and one without rubrics. This theory has later been criticized by Bergh 88, n. 18, who maintains that the missing rubrics in F were left out because the scribe knew Birgitta had nothing to do with them. These two explanations do not, however, eliminate one another. The third possible explanation could be that the scribe has refrained from writing out a number of the rubrics because he considered it necessary to economize with the parch- ment and perhaps also to save time. The use of the margins and other free space in the manuscript when entering the supplementary material seems to point to a certain thriftiness on the part of the scribe. 51 See Hollman 3o ff. (with ref.). 52 Cf. Hollman 35; Wessen XXII, XLII. In Gh and succeeding editions the text of Decl. I 3 has a greater range than in F and other manuscripts (except Mb; see pp. 115, 218) which lack §§ io—ii Hic etc. (see this ed. p. 249). Kraft's statement (pp. 76 and 92, n.2) that Decl. I 3 was compiled in Vadstena shortly before the text was printed in 1492 and that, all things considered, it would seem to appear first in Gh, only applies to the latter half of the supplement which, as far as I am aware, appears first in Gh (see pp. 115, 217 f.). The beginning of Decl. I 3 (§§ 8-9) is found, apart from F, also in Ba (written 1490), b (written 1 445), Mb and Ua. This part of the Decl. was joined, according to information in Ua, to Rev. 1 3 by Prior Petrus in 138o; see pp. 113 f. Hollman 35 has 
 
 
 
 
 95 Decl. 13. has been entered in two places: firstly in conjunction with ch. 13 in the lower margin of f. 12" after an insertion sign where it is marked as no. XLI but not as a declaracio, and secondly on f. 268r together with other supple- ments after Rev. VI.53 These are given the common rubric Reuelaciones extraua- gantes in the right—hand margin of f. 264rb. This latter version, which is neither numbered nor designated declaracio, gives a text that markedly diverges from the former version54 which in the main agrees with the text handed down in the manuscripts containing supplementary material.55 Decl. 16 has also been entered in two places: first in conjunction with ch. 16 on f. 15", where it is both marked declaracio and in the left-hand margin numbered as XLII, secondly amongst the Reuelaciones extrauagantes on f. 267v, where it is neither designated a declaracio nor given a number.56 The text of the second version diverges slightly from that of the first.57 Decl. 17 is entered in conjunction with ch. 17 on f. 16r, where it is given both the designation Declaracio and--in the left margin—the number XLIII.58 Decl. 23 has been entered in two places: first in conjunction with ch. 23 on f. 20v, where it is both marked as declaracio and numbered XLIIII (in the left-hand margin), secondly amongst the Reuelaciones extrauagantes on f. 268rb, where it is without number but has the following annotation written by Johannes Johannis in red ink: hec est declaracio xxiii capituli primi libri et ibidem plenius habetur. The second version is slightly shorter than the first since, at the end of § zo, it lacks consoletur (see this ed. p. 306). After the conclusion of the shorter et Ecclesia version (... manum judicantis) the scribe Johannes has written in red ink Et sic est finis harum reuelacionum. Deo gracias orate pro scriptore .J. J.59 Decl. 28 has been entered in conjunction with ch. 28 on f. 24vb, where it is both designated Declaracio and numbered xlv (in the central margin).60 criticized Kraft's above-mentioned statement which applies to the whole of Decl. 3 and considers that Kraft's dating is contradicted by the fact that the supplement is already found in F and C 31 (=Ua). However, here Hollman himself is guilty of making a partly false statement since he has ignored the fact that only the first part (§§ 8-9) of Decl. 3 is found in F and Ua; cf. Bergh V 72 f.; Diderichsen 236; Kraft 71, n. 1; Schiick 34, n. 34 (who erroneously says that the whole of Decl. I 3 has been adjoined by Prior Petrus; cf. Kraft 92, n. 2); Westman 46, n. 6. 59 See Hollman 51; Kraft 83; Wessen XV, XX, XXXV, XLI. 54 Thus, for example, there is in Decl. ][3: 8 Abbas quidam instead of Hic prior and sancta• B<ir- gitta> • instead of domina. The latter may indicate that this version of the Decl., which is amongst the supplementary material after Rev. VI, was entered (shortly) after Birgitta's canonization on 7th Oct. 1391; cf. 1313. 94, 218-221. 55 For more details see pp. 218-221. 56 See Hollman 51; Kraft 83; Wessen XV, XX, XXXV, XLI. quieuit are missing at the end. See p. 218, 57 It is, for instance, shorter as §§ 12-13 et audiui n. 10. 58 See Hollman 31; Wessen XX, XLI. 59 See pp. 92 f.; cf. Diderichsen 236; Hollman 31, 51; Kraft 83; Wessell XV, XX, XXXV, XLI. 60 See Hollman 31; Wessen XX, XLI. 
 
 
 
 
 96 Decl. 32 has been entered in conjunction with ch. 32 on f. 27", where it is marked as Declaracio and in the left margin numbered xlvi.61 As we have seen, Decl. 13, 16, and 23 have each been entered in two different versions in separate places in the text. Only in one case (Decl. 23) does the scribe himself seem to have been conscious of this fact. Almost certainly these supple- ments have been copied from different originals. In my opinion the scribe of F, Brother Johannes Johannis from Kalmar, used as his main exemplar a somewhat revised copy of the text of the so-called Liber Alphonsi in Vadstena Cloister (see pp. 17 ff.). In this exemplar probably most, perhaps all, of the supplements (addiciones, declaraciones etc.) were missing. However, the supplements that have been entered suo loco in F, for example Decl. I 16, 17, 23, z8, 32, may, as Wessen maintains,62 already have been found in the exemplar, either in the text itself or in the margins. It is also possible that in the relevant chs. in this exemplar there has only been a note that the text should be supplemented there and a reference as to where the respective supplements were to be found. In the course of his work the scribe has tried, to the best of his ability, to enter and arrange this and other supplementary material. When editing and tran- scribing the text he seems also to have himself made certain alterations in the text.

During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries many transcriptions of Saint Birgitta's Liber celestis reuelacionum were made in Vadstena Cloister. The two most complete of those preserved to the present day are, as far as I know, F and K.1 The former MS. has been subject to thorough examination, especially by Wessen (see p. 92). The latter has been closely studied first by Westman, then by Kraft, Diderichsen and Bergh. A somewhat more detailed presentation of the Kalmar manuscript and its contents will be given here, as it will also be used for editions of other books of Birgitta's Revelations. K is a parchment manuscript in folio form bound between wooden boards covered with sheepskin. The skin is now rather worn. Both the right-hand corners of 61 The numerals are partly erased but can still clearly be discerned; cf. Hollman 31, n. 1; Wessell. XX, n. 2, XLI, n. 2. 62 Wessen XXIII, XLIV. Among other, less complete, manuscripts from Vadstena Cloister containing Revelations may be mentioned Mb (see p. I 15), U (= cod. A 32 in the Royal Library, Stockholm, containing Rev. V— VII, ES, Rev. VIII, SA; see Bergh 63 with ref.), u (= cod. C 519 in Uppsala University Library; containing Rev. III—IV; see Hollman 48; Kraft 47 f., n. 3; Westman 270; below, p. 98, n. 2). 
 
 
 
 
 97 the front cover and the upper left-hand corner of the back cover have worn away com- pletely and been partly ripped open, so the wooden board is exposed there. The MS. has originally had two sheepskin clasps reinforced with brass and which are now broken. The spine of the book has six raised bands. Of the two red headbands the lower one is completely visible as the earlier surrounding skin has come loose there. The provenance of the MS. is clearly apparent from the following note written in brown-black ink on the inner side of the front cover, on a page of parchment fastened to the cover and which together with f. 2 form a sheet: liber iste reuelacio- num beate birgitte pertinet monasterio Watzstenensi. The handwriting, which would seem not to be that of the man who has written the majority of the MS., appears nevertheless to be from the same date. To the left of this note is the stamp of KALMAR LAROVERKS BIBLIOTEK. The mark of the MS. in Vadstena Cloister library was, no doubt, F II 29, i.e. F secundo secundus.2 2 This mark, which is to be found on the outer side of the front cover of the MS., indicates that K, in accordance with the marking system used in the library, was the second manuscript on the second shelf of bookcase F; on this marking system see, for example, Andren, De septem sacr., 62 ff., Godel 95 ff., Maliniemi 129, 136 f., Silfverstolpe, En blick, 102 f., Walde 58 f. There are, however, differences of opinion on whether the letter in the Vadstena mark of the manuscript was F or E. For on the inner side of the front cover is found the mark E no 29; i.e. F secundo secundus. Referring to this mark and the note of provenance, Westman states (Tvd handskrzfter, p. 23) that the mark of K in Vadstena Cloister library was E,II,29, Collijn (Stifts- och liiroverksbiblioteket i Kalmar, p. 12) E H 29, Kraft (79, n. I) E ii 2u s. Bergh (6z, n. 31) considers Westman's and Kraft's assertions to be incorrect and maintains that the MS. had the mark F II 2u s. If Bergh means by this the same mark, i.e. the mark on the inner side of the front cover, then he ought to have explained w hy this E is to be interpreted as F; cf. Bergh 63, footnote 33; 71, footnote 6. It could be suspected that the F in the manuscript-mark had deliberately been changed to E in the Cloister library or also that there had originally been an E on the outer side of the front cover but which as a result of the worn state of the skin has come to look like an F. There are, however, several manuscripts from Vadstena Cloister where there is uncertainty just with respect to E and F in their marks. This is apparent from, for instance, Annerstedt's unpublished manuscript catalogue of the so-called C-collection in Uppsala University Library, where most of the preserved Vadstena Latin manuscripts are to be found. In order to throw light on this not unimportant question, I have studied how the letters E and F are written both in the text of the K manuscript and in the marks of chosen C-manuscripts. This investigation has shown that E was written with a "rounded back": (see, for example, K, f. 331.1)), whereas F was written with a "straight back" and a "foot" of varying length: F, E etc. (see, for example, K, ff. 9vb , 24 rb , 32vb, 42 va) . It seems to me that the situation in cod. C 65 is most instructive; the Vadstena mark is written out no less than three times: I) on the inner side of the front cover: f p'mo Io, a) f. 05v: E p' ° I o"s 3) on the outer side of the back cover: E I ro (I am grateful to Dr. Oloph Odenius, Svenska riksarkivet, who has had the kindness to direct my attention to this MS.). Generally it can be said that in a Vadstena mark what looks like an F or E (with "straight back") should be interpreted as F, whereas (with "rounded back") is with all certainty to be considered as an E. Clear evidence of E in Vadstena marks can be found in, for example, the following manuscripts: C 10 = C5 V 9 (on the outer side of the front cover), C 300 = p'° ious (head of f. C 305 = 3 3° es (head of f. I r). This latter mark may be compared with that in C 48: E iii 8" (at the head of the inner side of the back cover). These two manuscripts, the Vadstena marks of 9 — 774372 C.-G. Undhagen 
 
 
 
 
 98 Codex Calmariensis (or Kalmarnensis; cf. p. 93) consists of 26o leaves which are normally 28 X 19 cm in size. The text is entered in two columns, generally comprising 40-50 lines each. The face is almost throughout circa 20,5 X 13 cm. The manuscript consists of 23 quires which generally comprise 6 sheets (i 2 leaves) each. Catchwords are found at the foot of the following verso pages: 50, 62, 74, 86, 98, 110, 118, 152, 215, 237. The size of the quires are more precisely the following: Quire I: ff. 1-2. Quire 2: ff. 3-14. Quire 3: ff. 15-26. Quire 4: ff. 27-38. Quire 5: ff. 39-50. Quire 6: ff. 51-62. Quire 7: ff. 63-74. Quire 8: ff. 75-86. Quire 9: ff. 87-98. Quire I 0: ff. 99-110. Quire II: ff. 1-118. Quire 12: ff. 119-126. Folio 1 has originally formed a sheet together with a leaf that has been cut out of the manuscript. As mentioned above, folio 2 together with the front fly-leaf attached to the inside of the front cover forms a sheet. Between ff. 31 and 32 a leaf has been cut away level with the inner margin, similarly so between ff. 33 and 34. These two leaves together formed a sheet. Between ff. 112 and 113 two leaves have been cut out which earlier, together with f. 115 and f. 116 respectively formed each their own sheet. Of the cut-out leaves only their inner margins are left, bearing the chapter numbers i5i, <1>52, 153, <1>55. The text on folio 1 i2va finishes approximately in mid-column with the end of the so-called Tractatus de summis pontificibus, which in Gh comprises Rev. IV 136-144 (see p. 23, n. 93). This chapter is denoted in the manuscript as 148 ( = Gh 144). However, 149 was previously written. The error has arisen through the scribe having by mistake apprehended therubric of Rev. IV 136 as a separate chapter, the actual text of IV 136 has then been denoted as 137 etc. The rubricator or some other corrector has noticed the mistake and in the left margin of f. I09va has written in red ink over an erased but faintly discernible 136: rubrica esse deberet istud, and the last figure of the chapter numbers which would seem to be identical, have in fact stood on different shelves, E resp. F, although they have had the same position on the respective shelves. In consideration of the facts given here it will be possible and even necessary to revise several erroneous pieces of information about manuscripts where the Vadstena marks have been given as containing the letter E. This applies to, for example, C 15=F v° xi" in ordine (E v° etc., which is at the head of the inner side of the front cover; cf. Andren, De septem sacr., p. 73, where an attempt has been made to reconstruct the arrangement of the manuscripts on shelf E of the Vadstena Cloister library; Annerstedt I 3z, Ekwall 16—zo, Holl- man 53, 87, Undhagen 73 ff.), C 75=F 3° 9' (E etc., on the inner side of the front cover), C 331 =F IIII xi" in ordine (E etc., f. C 518 =F primo 3" (E etc., in the upper right-hand corner of f. II.; cf. Annerstedt II, 482; Kraft 108, n. 5; Westman 278,n. 2; cf. below, p. 103, n. 12), C 519 p'° 13us (=E etc., head of f. 135v; on the outer side of the back cover is E 1 13; cf. above, p. 96, n. 1; Annerstedt II, 485). As far as the Vadstena mark of K is concerned, on the basis of the ana- lysis described here, I share Bergh's opinion that it was F II 2" . 
 
 
 
 
 99 has then been changed so that the chapters have numbers 136-1482a. Thereafter followed a chapter, in the left margin denoted as i5o; however, the text, which has taken up the remainder of f. 1 i 2v and the majority of the left column of the following page (now cut out), is erased. The erroneous chapter numbers 150-155 have not been corrected to 149-154. This has obviously been considered unneces- sary as the text to these chapters has been removed from the manuscript. Conse- quently we do not know which revelations are denoted by these chapter numbers. However, I strongly suspect that they can have been the same 6 revelations which end Book IV in F (ff. Inra-I 80vb); namely Extray. 5o, 51, 62, 75, 89, 17 (see Hollman 33, 44 f., footnote 6, 51; Kraft 83; Wessen XIV, XXIV, XXXIV f., XLIV).3 The two Vadstena manuscripts F and K show certain other common 2a Westman has pointed out (Tvd handskrifter, p. 23) that Book IV contains 148 chs. in K. Regarding this important statement Kraft 79 says that the numbering of the chapters to 148 in this book is a secondary marginal order without importance to the textual history. Actually this chapter numbering—like the numbering indicated by me of chapters up to and including 155 in the same book—is of the utmost importance for the clarification of the textual history of the Revela- tions. 8 This series of Extravagantes was also found in R ( — V in Hollman 51 f.) and t (= Z in Holiman 52; cf. ib. p. 33). They belong to a category of Extray. which Hollman calls "KLASS II" and which —according to him—may have been included in Prior Petrus' deposition in Vadstena in 1380; see Hollman 49; cf. Wessen XXII f., XLII f.; above, pp. 28 ff. The revelations that are entered in K at the end of Book IV after chapter i3o have been given the common rubric Extrauagantes incipiunt (cf. Diderichsen 243), entered in red ink in the left margin of f. 07'. The rubric is partly erased but can still be read (see p. 106). I am of the opinion that the revelation entered in K as number 15o has been Extray. 5o in the above Extrauagantes. I have been led to this conclusion by certain letters and words still legible at the beginning of the revelation. It is clear that the chapter initial has been an M written in red ink. There may have stood Maria, the word which opens Extray. 5o. That the succeeding revelation, chapter 151 in K, was in all probability identical with Extray. 51 is supported by the following interesting fact. In two manuscripts originating from Vadstena Cloister, cod. Upsaliensis C 331, f. 175', resp. C 306, f. 216r, is cited, as Hollman points out (44 f., note 6), in a sermon of Johannes Borquardi (monk at Vadstena from 1428, Confessor General 1443-1444, t 1447; see Silfverstolpe 85 f.; cf. Andren, De septem sacr., p. 69) Rev. IV 151, which proves to be exactly Extray. 51. In the first-mentioned manuscript, f. 175", lines 9 sq., we read the following: christus iiii libro reuelacionunz capitulo clj ... sic dicit Miraris quare loquor verba mea. eleua oculos (Miraris etc. --Extray. 51: 2). It should, however, be pointed out that the chapter number di ( =151) has been partly scraped away; this may be in connection with a revision carried out in Vadstena during the 15th century of the so-called reuelaciones extrauagantes which were then compiled into a special book, and their definite order was established with the Gh edition (see Hollman 28-45). The order found in K of the supplementary material at the end of Rev. IV has obviously been in use in Vad- stena for a while during the first half of the 15th century (see below). Besides the above-mentioned extrauagantes this redaction would seem to have included at least one revelation; namely Extray. 8o which is cited as Rev. IV 156 in a Vadstena manuscript from the end of the 14th century, cod. Ups. C 203 (Vadstena mark: I VI 8", found on the outer side of the front cover; cf. Andren, De septem sacr., p. 81), f. 181 r, line 3o: Mater dei quarto libro celesti 156 (1,. li ce IG6) ad beatam Bir- gittam sic dicit: ego sum ad quam angelus dixit Aue gracia plena etcetera ... (ego sum etc. =Extray. 8o: I); cf.

 100 features at the end of the above-mentioned Book, which strengthen my suspicion. —Between ff. 119 and 120 a leaf has been cut out which previously together with f. 126 formed a sheet.

Quire 21: ff. 226-237. Quire 22: ff. 238-249. Quire 23: ff. 250-260. Fol. 167 is a loose insert circa 16,5 x 18,5 cm. In the upper margin of f. 218" the scribe apologizes for a transgression with the following words: parcatis michi quia ignoranter transgressus sum metam. The scribe has there had to resort to half a column of a new leaf in order to finish the last chapter of Rev. VIII. Foll. 218v and 219 lack column divisions and text. Between ff. 219 and 220 two leaves have been cut out which together with ff. 220 and 221 resp. originally formed a sheet. In the last quire f. 25o and the fly leaf stuck to the inside of the back cover form a sheet. After f. 256 two leaves have been removed, which together with f. 251 and f. 252 resp. each formed a sheet. The two leaves removed have contained the text of at least Rev. IV 104 B (ex.) up to and including the end of the chapter (pectus aperiendum.) and the whole of chapter 105.4 The text of these two chap- ters corresponds to that of Rev. VIII 27-28 which was entered in the manuscript on f. 20orb-200"b and to which from Rev. IV 104 resp. 105 (f. 96"; see below, pp. 105 f.) the scribe originally referred. The leaves of the manuscript were originally unnumbered. But on the recto pages, in the upper right-hand corner, by writing 1, 2, 3, A,, Cj, , 6, A , 8 etc., it is stated which book of the Revelations the respective leaves contain. Moreover, above the text on the appropriate double page there is Liber Primus, Liber Secundus etc., Liber Septimus, Liber Octauus, etc. (see pp. 104—II I) by means of which the reader can find his way quite easily in the manuscript. In order further to facilitate its use I have numbered in pencil the recto pages in the lower right-hand corner. The chapter rubrics, generally entered in red ink, are for the most part numbered in the margin s, usually with red Roman numerals, sometimes with Arabic numerals and sometimes with both Arabic and Roman numerals (e.g. ff. 30r, 30v, 31 v). The revelations entered after Rev. IV 130 resp. VI 109, i.e. Rev. IV 131-148 (origi- nally 131-155; see above, pp. 98 f.) resp. VI 110-123, are numbered with Arabic numerals entered in the margins in the same brown coloured ink and—probably —by the same hand as the text of these revelations. The chapter numbers of VI 118-123 are, however, written in somewhat darker ink and possibly by another hand.5 Cf. Diderichsen 243; Westman, Tvd handskrifter, p. 24, n. 2. Diderichsen states (p. 243), incorrectly, that Rev. IV 131-144 (by this he presumably also means the succeeding chs. 145-148) lack chapter numbers in K. He also maintains that Rev. VI 4 5 
 
 
 
 
 I OI The chapter initials are generally red, in some cases blue (e.g. ff. I I5ra, I27ra, I7Ora, I92ra, i.e. at the beginning of Rev. V, VI, VII and V///), lilac (e.g. ff. I I5rb, II5vb, I I7va) and green (e.g. ff. I 27ra, 128r"). The majority of the text has been entered by one and the same scribe who seems also to have acted as rubricator. Another scribe has later entered certain additions; namely, ff. 113-114 (list of the rubrics in Rev. V), f. 167 (rubrics to Rev. VI 11 0-123) and ff. 247ra-26ora (see below). Revision of the text has been carried out by both scribes. The earlier has, for instance, on f. 20ra, line 19 ( =Rev. 134, 16) added in the margin a previously omitted exterius; the later has in several places changed the text or made it clearer, for example, f. I 02r" in Decl. IV 125 and f. 245r" in Or. IV E (med). His most important contribution is, however, the following. When reading through the manuscript this later scribe has noticed that certain textual material is entirely missing and that certain material entered is incomplete in the relevant places. This applies partly to a number of the declaraciones and addiciones (a total of 19) to Rev. IV, VI and VIII (see below) which for some reason the first scribe had not entered in the manuscripts, and partly to a few chapters (or parts of chapters) which were not written suo loco in Rev. II—IV but in Rev. VIII (Liber celestis imperatoris ad reges).7 In the latter case the first scribe had been content to give the beginning of the respective chapter and refer to the corresponding chapter in Rev. VIII. His references, Require libro ad reges etc., have—usually--been changed by the later scribe to Require post finem tocius huius libri. At the end of the manuscript, ff. 247ra-260ra, this later scribe has entered the material that he has found missing from the text. It is introduced with the following headings, which not only tells us why this textual material is appended but also enables us to establish approximately when this occurred: Sequntur quidam defectus in libro Reuelacionum suprascripto9, pro quibus de ipso libro a locis suis debitis fit remissio ad infrascripta. Et ideo, si secundum librum istum debent alzj libri jam conscripti reformari uel suppleri, sicut iste est reformatus et suppletus, in eorum defectibus reformentur. Si vero" debent alzj libri 110-122 (he does not express his opinion about ch. 123) were originally without chapter numbers. In my opinion these chapters (including VI 123; cf. p. 107 with footnote 43) were probably number- ed when they were written into the manuscript. The numbering may have been in the original manuscript from which K was copied. The chapter numbers 131-135 in Book IV and 110-123 in Book VI may well have been written in brown ink to emphasize the "extravagant" character of these revelations, since the immediately preceding chapter numbers in these books, like most of the chapter numbers in the MS., are, as mentioned above, written in red ink. Cf. Hollman 3o ff., 46 ff.; Kraft 72 ff.; Wessen XV, XVIII f., XXIII f., XXXV, XXXVIII f., XLIV f.; Westman 45 f. An exception is Add. IV 17 and Decl. VI 35, which have been entered by both scribes; cf. Diderichsen 245, n. 1. 7 On this secondary arrangement which is also found in other manuscripts, e.g. in Fb M q, see above, p. 3o; below, pp. 102-104, 118, 206-208; cf. Diderichsen 244-246; Kraft 75 ff.; Westman 48; Westman, Tvd handskrifter, p. 24 with footnote 1. Previously published in Diderichsen 244.

 102 secundum ipsum de nouo conscribi, jsta infrascripta ad loca sua debita ascribantur. Quibus peractis inter libros huiusmodi originales et integros atque per doctores exa- minatos et defensatos ex vna parte et istum suprascriptum seu illos sic reformatos et conscriptos parte ex altera nulla erit diminucio seu superfluitas, variacio uel deformitas, que saltem sensum variat uel intellectum. Thus the scribe has wished to supplement K with such text material as he has found missing. If other Revelation manuscripts which lack the same material are to be supplemented, this should be done in conformity with K. If new transcriptions are made using K as original, these addenda should be entered in the appro- priate place in the respective book. Accordingly the chapters common to Books //—/V and Book VIII should be written out in both placesn and the declaraciones and addiciones attached to the chapter to which they belong. In this way these Revelation books become, both in respect of scope and content, consistent with the ones which were per doctores examinatos et defensatos. Westman has rightly connected these words with the defence of the Revelations at the Basle synod and thereby obtained a terminus a quo for the second scribe's work: not earlier than the 1430's.12 The cited heading, it is true, could be taken to refer to earlier 11 The later scribe says nothing about these chapters being written out in Book VIII, but since he has scraped out and changed the first scribe's references to this book he must naturally have been aware that they were there. That, despite this, he has written them out at the end of the manuscript, Westman (Tvd handskrifter, p. 24) considers a completely supererogatory work as all the chapters in question are found in Book VIII; cf. Kraft 79, footnote 4. Here both Westman and Kraft are much too incautious in their appraisement of the later scribe's work, having over- looked the fact that the text of the chapters common to Rev. II-IV and Rev. VIII is not completely identical either with respect to scope or form. For example, in Rev. VIII 33, the chapter corresponding to Rev. II 9, there is a long passage missing; namely, Rev. II 9: 2-16 (proiecit clipeum appetitum) which in Gh takes up the greater part of §§ A-B. Rev. 11 9: 2 alter corresponds in Rev. VIII 33 to Nunc autem dico tibi de alio. These and other alterations to the text in the rele- vant chapters have certainly been initiated by Alfonso in connection with the compilation of Rev. VIII; see above, pp. 22-25, 29 f.; cf. Bergh 35, footnote 4, 95; Kraft 133 ff.; Westman 25 ff. It is absolutely clear that the later scribe of K has been aware of these textual discrepancies. What he has wished to achieve with his "supererogatory work" is to restore the original order and to give the revised chapters their—in his opinion—original content and form in Rev. II-IV. By collecting to one place in the manuscript all the missing material the scribe has, indeed, performed a very useful task and facilitated the work of those who wished to reformare and supplere other Revelation manuscripts with the help of K. " See Westman, Tvd handskrifter, pp. 23 f.—Birgitta's Revelations were subjected to sharp attacks during the famous synod at Basle, 1433-1436. Their orthodoxy and authority were questioned. The assailants' criticisms of certain parts of the Revelations were put forward in 123 articuli. Bir- gitta's foremost defenders were the learned Spanish Dominican, subsequently Cardinal, Johannes de Turrecremata (Juan de Torquemada) and Heymericus de Campo (Heimerich von Kampen), Professor of Theology at Cologne, later at Lowen. The former examined all 123 articles and wrote a Defensorium (see above, p. 3). In its entirety this is composed of an Authentication (see pp. 103 f., foot- note 15), a Prologue consisting of 6 chapters, plus the Defence itself. The original, marked A 24 b, is now preserved in the Royal Library, Stockholm; see Collijn, Birgittautstiillningen, p. 152. Chapter 6 of the Prologue and the whole Defence were printed by Mansi XXX, 699-814. The Authentication, the whole Prologue plus the beginning of his defence against articulus 1 and the end of that against 
 
 
 
 
 103 investigations and defences of the Revelations13, but that it really is a question of their treatment at the Basle synod I consider to be supported by the following fact. In several places the later scribe has written in the margin in red ink articulus (in most cases an attempt has been made later to scrape these away). I have investigated the places where articulus was to be found—these have escaped the notice of earlier scholars—and found that in most cases they answer the articuli treated by Turrecremata in his Defensorium (see footnote 12).14 The later scribe's supplementary and revisionary work in K was, in my opinion, probably carried out at the very earliest in 1436, in which year Turrecremata's Defensorium, like the other defences which appeared during the Basle synod, might have existed in transcription in Vadstena Cloister.15 articulus 123 were printed in Gh 1492 (see Collijn, Sveri ges bibliografi intill dr I600 , I, pp. i i8, I2i) and subsequent editions up to and including that of 1680 (see above, P. 4). Heymericus de Campo's defence concerned 79 articles. This has not to my knowledge been printed, but is included in several manuscripts; e.g. Ba (see p. 124), cod. Ups. C 31, ff. I 12r-125v, C 91 and C 518, cols. 315-684 (some- what deficient); the last three MSS. originate from Vadstena Cloister (cf. above, p. 15, n. 40). In the last-mentioned manuscript one finds the most important defences of the Revelations collected (see Westman 278, footnote 2). At the beginning, ff. 8ra---2o," there is a very useful index of which places in the Revelations the mentioned articuli refer to and which defenders have pronounced on the respective articulus. The index opens with the following rubric: Incipit registrum Articulorum ex libris reuelationum beate birgitte extractorum et per doctores declaratorum. The manuscript begins (f. I r) with a reference to how the erudite defenders' explanations should be used in the Cloister when reading the Revelations. The rubric reads: Qualiter legantur ad mensam libri reuelacionum beate birgitte cum suis declaracionibus et defensorio.—On the treatment of Birgitta's Revelations by the Basle synod and connected questions see HOjer 201-221; Kraft Io8 f.; Losman, Norden och reformkonsilierna 1408-1449, 199 ff., 244 ff.; Silfverstolpe, Om kyrkans angrepp, pp. 13 ff.; Und- hagen, Une source; Westman 277-289; cf. J. Svennung, Zur Geschichte des Goticismus, Uppsala, 1967, 34-43. 13 See pp. 13 ff. (Hojer 115 ff.; Kraft 65 ff., Io8 ff.). 14 Here are some examples: f. 30ra (Rev. I 52: I 0-- Turn art. 23, 721; f. I2ovb (Rev. V int. 12 r. q. I) =Turn art. 67, 757 sq.; f. 133vb (Rev. VI 2I)= Turn art. 81, 772 sq.; f. 2I7ra (Rev. VIII 56)= Turn art. 116, 804 sq.; articulus is found partially erased on e.g. ff. 129', 130ra, 133 ra, 1351.1), 13 8/.1), i4.0rb, 148rb, 238ra. On the 27th June 1436, according to the Vadstena diary (DV, p. 86; SRS, I: 1, 153; cf. HOjer f.), the Confessor General of the cloister (i.e. Gervinus Petri; see Silfverstolpe 84 f.) came home from the Church Assembly at Basle. Presumably he brought with him transcriptions of the Defen- soria which Turrecremata and others had written in connection with the above-mentioned articuli (see above, footnote i2). Such defensoria or declaraciones (cf. footnote 12) were apparently found in Vadstena Cloister anyway in 1438, since in the Vadstena diary (DV, 88; SRS, I: 1, 154), it is stated that Brother Petrus Olavi, former parish priest of Kil (in Narke), who died on May 19th 1438, scripsit .. . declaraciones doctorum super articulis extractis de reuelacionibus sancte birgitte in concilio basiliensi. It is not improbable that this Petrus Olavi has written out in C 518 at least a part of the defence. Turrecremata examined the mentioned articuli and issued his Defensorium in Basle 1435. This is evident from an authentication indited in the form of a letter in which he says: ... existentes adhuc 15 210 in Basiliensi concilio, videlicet anno omnes predictarum reuelationum libros M.CCCC.XXXV studiose et diligenter perlegimus et ... expositiones et declarationes ... super ... prefatis articulis edidimus.

 104 From the later scribe's heading to his supplementary material we can assume that the copies16 of Birgitta's Revelations that were examined during the Basle synod had the same scope and content as cod. K reformatus et suppletus in accord- ance with the references in the heading. This implies, among other things, that the chapters common to Rev. II—IV were written out in both places in this "Basle edition".17 Here follows a detailed account of the contents of K: ff. 1r-2v: blank except for the following note on f. Ir from modern times: Revelae' s (= Revelationes) S. Birgitthx. 3ra-4vb: Prol. M. Rubric (in red): Yncipit prologus in libro reuelacionum celestium beate memorie domine birgitte de swecia diuinitus sibi factarum qui prologus fuit editus per venera- bilem virum magistrum Mathiam de szvecia. Text: STupor fatebantur, after which follows in red ink Explicit prologus. At the top of every page Prologus is written in brown ink but underlined in red. ff. 4vb_34rb: Rev. I (with rubrics). Chapter rubrics in red, as is the text in the Incipit and. the Explicit and also the initial to the actual text of every chapter. jncipit priinus liber re- uelacionum celestium domine birgitte de swecia. Rubrica priori capituli . . . Explicit liber primus. Above the text on f. 5r isjncipit prirnus liber, from f. 5v onwards Liber Primus. Of declara- ciones only that to chapter 3 is missing (see p. 218). The others are entered by the first scribe in conjunction with chapters 13, 16, 17, 23, 28, 32. The text is usually preceded by the sign II, and is marked in the margin as declaracio (written in red ink); cf. Diderich- sen 236, Kraft 79 f. ff. 34rb_ 5orb: Rev. II (with rubrics). Chapter rubrics in red, etc. as in liber I. Jncipit se- cundus liber Continens in se xxx capitula ... Explicit liber secundus (cf. p. 2o6). Above the text on f. 34r is Incipit Liber Secundus, from f. 34v onwards Liber Secundus. Only a few lines of the text of chapters 6, 9, II have been entered. Of chapter 12 only about half (§§ 1-31) is written out, corresponding to Gh 12 A—D in. (... misericordiam meam). Of chapter 13 finally about 1/3 (§§ 1-12) has been written out, corresponding to Gh deles) from 1446 precedes in Gh his Defensorium and also in subsequent printed editions up to and including that of 1680; see above, footnote 12; Hojer 220 f.; Undhagen, Une source, pp. 215 f.; cf. DV, ioo; SRS, I: 1, 164. According to Hojer 207 Turrecremata's examination was presumably completed in January 1436. 16 We do not know how many copies of the Revelations were put at the disposal of the defenders. For practical reasons it must in any case have been more than one. In the course of the Church Assembly's meeting there certainly appeared in Basle several transcriptions of the Revelations; cf. pp. 3o f.; Dahl-Bring II, 48 f.; Lehmann, Erforschung des Mittelalters (1941), pp. 253 ff., 270 ff.; Schack, Den svenska forlagsbokhandelns historia, I, 16 f. 17 When discussing in the defence the respective articulus, reference is made in such cases only to the book where the "double chapter" first appeared. Thus it is stated, for example, that Turr. art. 27, 723 sq. (= C 518, col. 121) refers to a passage at the end of Rev. II 6. This chapter corre- sponds to Rev. VIII 42, but no reference is made to the last-mentioned chapter in the discussion of the articulus in question. In K, which has the chapter written in full in the latter place, the word articulus has been entered at the end of the chapter in the margin, f. 2o7", in red ink. Thus this does not exactly agree with the defence reference to Rev. II 6! In order to avoid such discrepancies and to facilitate the use of the defence it was necessary to have manuscripts with the chapters in question in the "right place". K originally did not and this was probably one of the reasons why the second scribe made changes and additions to the manuscript. 
 
 
 
 
 105 13 A-C in. (... pro sanguine meo). In all the above cases there has originally been a ref- erence after the text to the corresponding chapter in Book VIII; namely, chapters 42, 33, 37 (3A remains in the margin f. 39", entered in brown ink beside Rev. II II), 36, 35. These references have, as mentioned above, been changed to Require post finem tocius huius libri by the later scribe who on ff. 247"--250" has entered the whole of chapters 6, 9, i i plus somewhat more than the remainder of chapter 12 (from § 31 [ = Gh 12 D in.] Nunc ergo ...) and 13 (from § 12 [ = Gh 13 C in.] Nam voto suo ...). In K there are no references from Rev. VIII 42, 33, 37, 36, 35 to the corresponding chapters in Rev. II; cf. Kraft 79 ff. The Declaracio to chapter 2 is also there, entered and marked in the same way as Decl. in Book I (see above). The supplement appearing in Gh and subsequent editions at the end of chapter 13 (Hic miles creditur fuisse dominus Karolus filius sancte Birgitte) but which is missing from K, should be considered as a declaracio (see above, p. 2, n. 5). ff. 5orb-64rb: Rev. III (with rubrics). Chapter rubrics in red, etc., as in liber I. ,incipit tercius liber continens in se xxxiii capitula ... Explicit liber tercius (cf. pp. 206 f.). Above the text on f. 50" is Jncipit Liber Tercius, from f. so' onwards Liber Tercius. All the chapters, except chapter 31, are written in full. Of chapter 31 only a few lines of the beginning are entered, then there follows the reference Require post finem tocius huius libri (post ... libri in ras.). Originally the reference was to Rev. VIII 24 (see above, p. f). The whole of Rev. III 31 has been entered by the later scribe on f. 250"-250". Addiciones and declaraciones are found entered at the end of the following chapters:18 10,19 11,20 12, 21 13 , 22 I 9 , 22, 33 fr. 64"-1 fa: Rev. IV: 148 chapters23. 5ncipit liber quartus Reuelacionum. There is no Expli- cit in Book IV. On f. 64r, above the text is ,incipit liber quartus and from f. 64' onwards Liber Quartus. The 148 chapters correspond to Gh Rev. IV 1-135, VI 63, IV 136, 49, 137- 143, VII 31, VI 96, IV 144; cf. Westman 26 f., footnote 3. All the chapters, except for numbers 104, 105 and 136 (see above, p. Ioo), are given rubrics in red (cf. p. 98). Chapters 104 and 105 ( = Rev. VIII 27 resp. 28) are without rubrics here, but these, together with adherent text, have been entered by the later scribe on f. 256" and on two subsequent 18 Cf. Diderichsen 236. 19 The end of this addicio is according to Gh Hec reuelacio precedens facta fuit ad albanensem cardinalem qui tunc fuit prior but these words are denoted in K as declaracio and have been entered in darker ink above the text later than the addicio itself on f. 54". The declaracio should therefore be placed before the addicio. The same order is also found in other MSS.; for example in q. 20 The beginning of Add. i i (according to Gh), Hec reuelacio facta est de legato cardinali anni jubilei, is denoted in the margin f. 54" as Declaracio and has been entered later in a darker ink than the text to what is called Addicio in K. 21 The latter part of this Decl. (according to Gh), Cum ... romam, is denoted here, f. 55", as Addicio de eodem episcopo. 22 In Gh denoted as Addicio but in K as Declaracio, as also in F, where this addition is entered in the upper margin, f. 95'. In front of the supplementary text in K, entered in red ink as a rubric (in the margin the same [?] scribe has remarked here: capitulum istud 13 est), is the following: de episcopo lincopensi qui postea factus fuit archiepiscopus. "'tem de eodem vi libro xxii capitulo. Et incipit filius loquitur (filius loquitur in marg.) Ylle prelatus et (et infra lin.) de eodem. The same text is found—with slight discrepancies—in Gh and subsequent editions where it reads: Hec reuelacio eodem. This section of text is prelatus capitulo xxii, quod incipit facta est de episcopo missing from F, but is found in, for example, Ua, ff. 144v-14.5r, where it begins <P>recedens reue- lacio est de episcopo ... It should rather be considered as a declaracio to Rev. III 13. 28 See pp. 98 f. 
 
 
 
 
 i o6 leaves that have been removed from the manuscript and which contained the end of chapter 104 and the whole of ch. 105 (see p. ioo and references from chapters 104 and 105 below). The rubrics to chapters 132-148 that have been partly entered in the margins have probably been written in later than the text of these chs. The common rubric to chapters 131 ff., as mentioned above (p. 99, n. 3), was Extrauagantes incipiunt,24 which has later been erased. At the end of chapter 130 in the left margin, in red ink, is: hic est finis huius libri secundum alphosom (!).25 As a common rubric to chapters 132-135 a rubricator has written in the upper margin, f. 107", Jncipit tractatus reuelacionum beate birgitte de sacerdotibus. Above the text of these chapters, on ff. 108r-109r, Tractatus sacerdotibus is repeated. The first scribe has written in the right margin, f. 109", the following heading as common to chapters 136 ff.: Sequitur tractatus reuelacionum beate birgitte de summis pontificibus plus instructions that the subsequent rubric (Reuelaciones infrascriptas habuit in visione spirituali ... ex precepto dei omnipotentis26) is to be written cum incausto, i.e. in red ink. This is indeed the case. Above the text to these chapters on ff. 109v-112r is Tractatus pontificibus, on f. 112" only liber (cf. above, p. too). The chapter initials in Book IV are all red except for those in chapters 26, 144, 146 and 148 (green) and 143 (lilac). All the chapters are written in full except for the following: I, 3, 4, 17, 45, 48, 74, 103, 104, 105, 138, 146, 147. Of these only the beginning is given. There then follows a reference to where the respective chapters are to be found in full in the manuscript. As far as chapters 1, 3, etc. to 105 inclusive are concerned the reader is referred to post finem tocius huius libri, where these chapters have been entered in full by the later scribe, ff. 250"-256rb.27 In these cases the first scribe referred to the corresponding chapter in Book VIII; namely, 25, 41, 13, 15, 50, 7, 34, 26, 27, 28.28As far as Rev.

IV 141 [= Gh 139] a passage which is missing from Gh and subsequent editions.29 Addiciones and declaraciones are found to the following chapters30: 1631, 17, 24 In the corresponding place in F, f. 169rb: hic incipiunt extrauagantes ; cf. Diderichsen 240; Wessen XIV, XXXIV. -It should be pointed out that ch. IV 131 is also found in Ua, f. 155v, en- tered as the last supplement to Book IV. At the beginning there is in the left margin: in fine libri scripta fuit. 25 Cf. F, f. 169rb in the margin, and Gh (and subsequent editions) where in the corresponding place there is Hic est finis quarti libri secundum alphonsum, Diderichsen 240; Wessen XIV, XXXIV; above, pp. 17 f. " This rubric is also found in the printed editions; cf. Wessen XIV, XXXIV, where de reducendo should be added after tractant. 27 Ch. 103 has by mistake been numbered as 204 (ciiii, f. 256'). After the words quoted from chs. 204 and 105 is Require post finem tocius huius libri cum rubrica. As mentioned above (p. zoo), two leaves of the MS. are missing after f. 256. It must be assumed that these contained the greater part of ch. 104 as well as the whole of ch. 105 cum rubrica. 28 Cf. Kraft 79 ff.; Kraft, NTBB, 13, p. 160. 29 It begins Nota ista quatuor sequencia, que precipiuntur pape and ends habetur jn reuelacione que incipit pater sancte, veni igitur cum sequentibus. 30 Cf. Diderichsen 237. Rev. IV 74 ends in Gh with the words jste miles fuit dominus karolus filius sancte Birgitte which are missing from K and the other manuscripts that I have studied. The supplement seems to appear at the earliest in Gh, where it should have been marked as a declaracio; cf. p. 2., n. 5 (on Rev. II 13) and n. 7, p. 11o, n. 69 (on Rev.

 o8 the beginning of the adherent revelations—have, however, been entered by the later scribe on a special leaf, f. 167 (cf. pp. 100 f.). The rubric to ch. I Do has been marked x by mistake and the rubric to ch. III is not numbered. At the end of ch. 109 the rubricator has written in the margin of f. 166va Finis viti libri secundum alphonsum (cf. pp. 17 f.). Exactly underneath this note Extrauagantes reuelaciones45 was originally written, also entered in red ink but partly erased. Book VI—like Book IV (see above)—is with- out an Explicit. At the beginning of Book VI on f. 127' in the upper margin Jncipit Liber Sextus is written. Above the text on the following pages (ff. 127v-169r) Liber Sextus is repeated. All the chapters are written in full.46 Declaraciones resp. addicio- nes have been entered by the first scribe in conjunction with the following chapters: 3, 5, 9, 10, 35,47 36,48 39, 41,48 52, 75,58 9 -8, 102. At the end of the manuscript (ff. 258'- 259') the later scribe has entered supplementary material to the following chapters5l: 15_20, 52 23,53 28, 30,54 31,55 32, 35 (see footnote 47), 41 (see below, footnote 49). skrzfter, p. 24 (quartunz should be changed to quintum and cantum to cantu) is mentioned another part of K (in secunda parte huius opusculi) which contained, amongst other things, Reuelaciones extrauagantes (cf. p. 99, n. 3). 45 In the corresponding place in F, Reuelaciones extrauagantes is found; cf. Diderichsen 240 f.; Wesson XV, XXXV. 46 The latter half of ch. 65, corresponding to Rev. VI 65 O-P in Gh, has originally been numbered and considered as a special chapter, 66; these two figures, written in brown ink, can still be faintly made out on f. i5ora in the left margin. The same division of this chapter is to be found in several manuscripts, amongst others, in r. In this MS. Book VI (which in the Explicit on f. 118r is given as scriptus et correctus ex originalibus alfonsy) consists of II o chs.; see Bergh 36. 47 Decl. 35 has also been entered by the later scribe on f. 259v, see above, p. Ioi with footn. 6. 48 This declaracio is somewhat longer in K than in Gh. The end passage Cum idenz frater difficilis esset ad credendurn credulus reuelacionzim et defensor earum is missing from Decl. VI 36 in Gh, but is included in Decl. VI 30. That this passage has been erroneously entered in K has been ob- served by a corrector who in the left margin on f. I42va has remarked: Nota quod ista declaracio vacat. The later scribe has entered this passage plus three others at the end of the MS. (ff. 258vb- 259113) as a declaracio to Rev. VI 30; cf. below, footn. 54. 49 This addicio has been entered by mistake after ch. 51. The mistake has been observed and corrected partly by marginal notes on f. 146" at the end of ch. 41 (Addicio sequitur que ponitur infra post capitulum 1.jm ...) and on f. 149va at the end of ch. 51 (hic vacat hec addicio sed stabit post xljm capitulum vt supra notatuin est) and partly by the later scribe entering on f. 259vb a part of the supple- ment to Capitu/o xlj in fine plus a reference, Require post Capitulum lj in fine scriptunz et transpositum; cf. Fb p. 208 with footn. 32. " This supplement is not denoted in K either as a declaracio (as in Gh) or as an addicio and seems to have been incorporated into ch. 75. However, in the margin on f. 161ra a corrector has written the following note to this passage in greybrown ink: "'stud non habet alphonsus. 51 At the end of each chapter in question the same scribe has entered a reference—usually declaracio in fine libri requiratur—to these supplements. 52 Decl. VI 20 contains the following in K (Ua Q and some other MSS.) over and above the corresponding declaracio in Gh and the other printed editions: De isto eodem homine est reuelacio lxvj huius libri. vt contereretur et saluaretur) is missing 53 This declaracio (HEc tria capitula sunt de eodem from amongst others Ua, Gh and the other printed editions.

(f. 158v in the left margin): plures sunt hic ponende reuelaciones; see below, p. 114, n. 12. In K Decl. VI 3o ends with the following words which are missing from Gh: De isto fratre habetur eodem libro sexto Capitulo tercio Videbatur a sponsa quidam demon astare etcetera. 55 In K this declaracio ends with the words ... fine quieuit beato and it is somewhat shorter than in Gh where it has a further eight lines: Nam beata Birgitta . . . inflainmabatur caritate mea. Also in Ua the supplement is shorter than in Gh. 56 Cf. Kraft 105-107. 57 On Add. VI 94 see above, footn. 54; cf. Diderichsen 238; Kraft 80. 58 In certain MSS. there are 32 chs. since ch. 13 is divided into two chapters, 13 resp. 14; re- specting this see Bergh 43, 55, 88; Kraft 76; Westman 55. 59 In certain MSS., for example F r V, only the beginning of chs. 18, 19, 3o, which correspond to Rev. VIII 22, 23, 58, are written in and then follows a reference to the above-mentioned chapters in Book VIII. In Gh and the other printed editions the situation is reversed. In these the reader is referred from the named chapters in Book VIII to the corresponding ones in Book VII where they are printed in full. In K—as in several other MSS.—the chapters common to both books are written in full in both places (cf. below, footnotes 68 f.; Bergh 18, n. 8, 35 with n. 4, 37, 54 with n. 12, 58, 61 ff., 95; Kraft 77 ff., 85 f.; Wessen XV f., XXXVI; Westman 25 ff., 48 ff.; Westman, Tva hand- skrzfter, p. 24 with n. I). 60 On Liber celestis reuelacionum, which originally consisted of seven books, see pp. 16 if. 61 See Bergh 70-79; Diderichsen 238 ff. 62 Of Add. VII 4, §§ 17-19 are in K denoted as declaracio (central margin f. 17ov) and §§ 20-22 denoted as addicio (left margin f. 63 Denoted in K as declaracio (f. I72rb). At the beginning there would seem to have stood 'stud non habet alphonsus entered in brown ink; cf. above, p. 108, n. 50; Bergh 77. 64 In K this is not denoted either as an addicio or as a declaracio. But as a rubric to the supplement on f. 178vb in the upper margin is Sequencia vsque ad xvij capitulum non habet liber alphonsi entered in red ink; on the designation Liber Alphonsi see pp. 17 f.; cf. Westman, Tva handskrifter, p. 23, n. I. 65 The intention presumably was to remove the text on ff. 187-188 in order to be able to use these leaves for another text. 66 In its entirety it consists of 8 chapters with adherent rubrics of which the last, according to the rubric, is a prologus libri celestis imperatoris ad reges, i.e. a prologue to Rev. VIII; cf. pp. 22 f. 
 
 
 
 
 0 residuum huius prologi est folio post regulam in signo simili digiti. The remainder of ES does indeed follow at the given sign after the Regula Saluatoris on f. 226' (see below).67 In the upper margin on f. 189r is Prologus Ad Reges (this is repeated above the text on ff. 189°-191 v, 226r-229v) and above the left column is jncipit epistola solitarij ad Reges. ff. 192ra-218': Rev. VIII: 58 chapters68 (with rubrics, all entered in fu1168 by the first scribe; cf. above, pp. 'co f.). Chapters 6 and 7 with rubrics have been entered in inverted order, but this has later been corrected. All the chapters, except for number 23, are numbered:7o Above the text on ff. 192r-218r is Liber Octauus.71 The book opens with .7ncipit liber celestis jmperatoris ad reges Reuelatus diuinitus beate birghitte and finishes with Explicit liber reuelacionum ad reges. ff. 218v-219v: blank, unlined and without column divisions. ff. 22ora-225vb: RS: 3 + 31 chapters, with rubrics in red which on the whole agree with those in Gh.72 HJc incipit regula saluatoris data diuinitus ab ore christi deuotissime sponse sue domine birgitte intellectualem. Narratur hic modus qualiter domina birgitta habebat reuelaciones angelo falsitatis. IN dominio regis swecie73 dum michi placuerit. There is no Explicit. Above the text on f. 220ra is Jncipit Regula Saluatoris, on ff. 220v-225r Regula Saluatoris, on f. 225v Regula. In the upper margin of f. 220ra the following, partly erased, note is found: jste textus regule non est correctus nec est de bulla.74 47 The error has evidently arisen during the binding of the manuscript. 68 Nearly half of these consist of, as mentioned above, pp. 22, 29 f., more or less revised chapters from Rev. II-VII. In the printed editions the number of chapters has been increased to 61. The last three chs. consist of Extray. 27, 78, 8o to which the reader is referred in these editions. Of the other chapters that Book VIII has in common with the other Revelation books, only the beginning is entered in the printed editions. There then follows a reference to the "double chapter" in ques- tion. This applies to Rev. VIII 7, 8, 13, 15, 22-30, 33-38, 41, 42, 44, 50, 58; cf. above, p. io 1. 6' Chs. 16 and 17 end with the words ... amittat regnum resp. prudentem. In the printed editions these two chapters each end with a short revelation (Filius loquitur maiorem resp. Filius dei loquitur dolorosus). These revelations are, however, to be considered as secondary supplements and appear only in a few MSS., where they are explicitly marked as addiciones. This is the case in, for instance, K and F. In K the later scribe has, at the end of these chs., entered a reference to the end of the MS. (Addicio in fine requiratur, in the lower margin on f. 190, resp. addicionem Require in fine libri, in the central margin on f. 197r) where he has entered both these supplements under the rubric Addiciones ad octauum librum, f. 26ora, cf. Diderichsen 238, n. II; Hollman 35 f.; Kraft 76, n. 1 2; Wessen XXII, XLII. No other addiciones or declaraciones to the chapters of Rev. VIII are found in K. On the other hand, there are several marginal notes pointing out that certain chapters correspond to others in other books. Thus we learn that, for example, Rev. VIII 22, 23, 28 correspond to Rev. VII 18, 19 and VI 82, respectively; cf. above, p. 109, n. 59. In the upper margin of f. 218rb there is a note of another sort; see above, p. ioo. 70 The rubric to ch. i has been entered in the lower margin on f. 192ra. 71 On the designation Liber octauus see above, p. 2, n. II; Kraft 57, n. I; Kraft, En pamflett, p. 16, n. 3; Wessen XV, XXXVI; Westman 23, 25. 72 On Regula Saluatoris see above, pp. 2 f., n. 12; 18, n. 74. 73 In Gh: Noruegie; cf. Wessen, Svensk medeltid, pp. 63 if.; Westman 25; Lindblom, Vadstena klosters &len, pp. 24 74 This note should probably be interpreted to mean that the version of Regula Saluatoris (in prima persona) found in the MS. does not agree with that of the Papal bull issued by Urban VI, dated 3 Dec. 1378, which contained the constituciones of the Order (Regula in tercia persona); see above, p. 3, n. 12; Cnattingius 14-24; Gussgard 54 f.; Hollman 78 if.

The following should be mentioned. The first scribe has in two places (in the lower margin of f. 3' where the Prologus magistri Mathie begins resp. the upper margin of f. 220ra where Regula Salvatoris begins) asked for the Virgin Mary's guidance in writing out the text: Duc pennam, Rege cor, sancta (in the latter place there is alma) maria, precor! His prayer is, as is seen, written in Leonine pentameter. In another place in the manuscript the same scribe asks forgiveness for his transgressions in the writing out of Rev. VIII (see p. oo). As mentioned above (p. 103), the later scribe has in several places marked in the margin that a certain passage constitutes an articulus. It would seem to be this scribe that has also entered the following words in the upper margin of the inner side of the front cover: Jn nomine domini Amen genuit puerpera christum regem adoremus dominantem gentibus Qui se manducantibus dat spiritum. Earlier, attention has been drawn to the note by Edmar who published it in KA, 33, 351. His reading is, however, not entirely correct: pin,pa, aeternain, spem should be changed to puerpera, Qui, spiritum resp. The text (from and including genuit) is composed of the introductory words (Genuit puerpera) of a laud antiphon, used In nativitate Domini and of the matins invitatory (Christum regem ...) In festo corporis Christi; cf. Hesbert I, 36 f., III, 5, 235. In Breviarium Roma- num—and Brevarium Lincopense, the liturgical order of which was followed by the monks in Vadstena (cf. Undhagen 32 if.),—this invitatory does not end with spiritum but with spiritus mystice et allegorice ... de eucharistia" pinguedinem. On manducare= edere "in sermone christiano see TLL, VIII, 275, 8 sqq. with, for instance, the following examples: Salv. eccl. 2, 23 Iudaei manna manducavere, nos Christum, Iudaei carnes avium, nos dei corpus; cf. Vulg. Ioh. 6, 49 sqq.; Blaise, D — B and NG1 s.v. . manduco. As far as puerpera is concerned it may be mentioned that this designation 
 
 
 
 
 112 The later scribe, it would seem, as maintained above (p. 103), has entered his supplementary material in K at the earliest in 1436. We do not know for certain when the first scribe finished his part of the transcription of K. Neither is it known when and how the manuscript came to be in Kalmar laroverks bibliotek (see below footnote 84). Since K was given addiciones and declaraciones already by the first scribe—these, as mentioned above, pp. z8 f., began to be added to certain Revelations in 138083—, we have with this date a certain terminus post quern for the date of origin of the manuscript. According to Westman, Tvd handskrifter, p. 23, the main part of the manuscript has been written around the beginning of the 1400's or possibly the end of the 1300's. Diderichsen 246 thinks it likely that K is contemporaneous with "the sister manuscript from Munich" ( =M writ- ten 1394; see p. 116) and dates it to "ca. 1390". Collijn, Stifts- och laroverks- biblioteket i Kalmar, p. 12, believes the manuscript was written around the year 1400, while Kraft 78 states that K is the oldest manuscript preserved in full of Birgittas's Revelations in Latin. Bergh and Hollman do not give any personal for Jesus' mother also appears, for instance, in Prudentius (cath. 9, 19 0 beatus ortus ille, virgo cum puerp er a I edidit nostram salutem feta sancto spiritu) and Sedulius (hymn. II 1 7 Enixa est puer p er a, queen Gabrihel praedixerat). Under the above-mentioned note there is a much longer and later note plus four verses in rhyming couplets and written in hexameter. The text has previously, albeit not entirely correctly, been pub- lished in Westman, Tvd handskrifter, p. 25. Westman dates it to around the end of the 1400's or the beginning of the i5oo's. It reads (the punctuation is my own): Deputet confessor aliquem abilem fratrem, qui manuducit scolasticum—quia scola est res publica et vinea ecclesie sacrosancte ut in quolibet tenni no legat et exponat aliquem librum biblie, quia talis lectura deseruit eis futuris tempo- ribus in ambone et addiscunt ibi bonam gramaticam et rethoricam auctenticam, curam sapientibus alleganda<m>. Versus Biblia lecta scolis acuit sensus puerorum ut radius solis illuniinat astra polorum; per studium biblie datur optima teologia, hec noua sev vetera commendat summa sophia. In the two first verses Westman has incorrectly read acuat resp. astrum polodorum, which has been pointed out and corrected by Edmar, KA, 13, pp. 35o f. In fact the note gives us much of interest. The Confessor General (confessor = confessor generalis) of Vadstena is urged, we read, to see to it that the Bible is studied regularily in the Cloister school because the pupils will then not only learn "the best theology", but also "good grammar" (= Latin) and "true rhetoric". The usefulness of the Bible also as a textbook in grammar and rhetoric has, as is well known, been stressed by Augustinus, Cassiodorus, Aldhelmus, Beda Venerabilis and others; see, for example, Auerbach 46 ff., 178 f., 326 f.; Curtius 5o f., 56 f., 445 f., 452 f.; RAC, 2, pp. 351 ff. (s. v. Bildung); B. Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, Oxford, 1941, passim; cf. KLNM, 15, cols. 631-647 (s. v. Skole, Skolebeger). Concerning the so-called Cloister School in Vadstena see Linnarsson 8 ff.— Kraft 78 f. has completely misunderstood Westman's analysis of the content of the note discus- sed here, as he states that the manuscript (i.e. K) was meant for regular study of the Bible in the school which was connected with the Cloister. 83 The same supplements—with some exceptions—are found in the oldest dated Revelation manuscript, Fb, completed in 1386 (see p. 2o5), in the Munich manuscript M from 1394, in F, q and other manuscripts. 
 
 
 
 
 I13 opinion on the age of the manuscript. I myself have not found anything that speaks against dating K to the end of the 1300'5.84 The fact that in the above- mentioned (p. 97) note of provenance in K, Birgitta is called not sancta but beata can, but need not necessarily, imply that the manuscript came into existence b efore 7 Oct. 1391 when Birgitta was officially canonized.85 There is thus reason to date K to ca. 1380-1391. Ua = Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, MS. C 31, cent. XIV late and XV early, ff. I43r-160v (341). Lit.: Annerstedt I, 50-55; Hollman 36, n. I, 48-50, 54 f., 64 f.; Nyberg, NTBB, 58, (1974 17-33. Ua consists of 341 one-column paper leaves and includes a large number of Birgittine texts written by several different hands at the end of the 1300's and the beginning of the 1400's. These Birgittine texts have been bound together with other works, presumably during the first half of the 15th cent. Besides a number of Extray.,' RS in prima persona' (ff. 161r-167v) etc., the manuscript contains those supplements (addiciones and declaraciones) which Prior Petrus is supposed to have added at the end of certain chapters of the Revelations in "the year lady Katarina, St. Birgitta's daughter, and Magnus Petri, Confessor General, returned from Rome" to Sweden; i.e. in 1380.3 This collection of supple- mentary material, which takes up flf. 143r-I60v, was entered by the same hand throughout. Unfortunately the collection is incomplete as it ends approxi- mately in the middle of Decl. VI 98. The rest has been lost, presumably in binding. The supplementary material is introduced with the following rubric: 84 I have not had the opportunity to investigate in detail the identity of the scribes responsible for K. An analysis of the different handwritings in K and a comparison with those already identified handwritings in other Vadstena manuscripts (see Maliniemi 9 ff.) could possibly give an answer to this question. The note from ca. 1500 entered on the front fly leaf (see footnote 82) implies that the manuscript was still in Vadstena in the 16th century. It is possible that a monk or nun took it with them from the Cloister when it was dissolved in 1595 (see for example S. Dahl, Bokens historia, Stockholm, 1961, p. 132) and donated it to the Cathedral Library in Kalmar, from where it can later have come to Kalmar stifts- och laroverksbibliotek (cf. Collijn, Stifts- och laroverks- biblioteket i Kalmar; Dahl-Bring II, 223-225). I would remind the reader in this connection that the Vadstena diary mentions several monks and nuns from Kalmar, among whom may be mentioned Ericus Johannis (Confessor General 1401-1423, f 1 447), Johannes Johannis (1- 1446; it was he who wrote cod. F; see pp. 92 f.), Johannes Benechini (author of amongst other things four rhymed offices; f 1461) and Johannes Bernhardi (t 1445); see Silfverstolpe 81 f., 117, 128-13o; cf. ib. 74; Andren, De septem sacr., pp. 82 f., note 58, 85, 102; NISL, I2, pp. 204 f., 391 ; Undhagen 35 8. Kalmar belonged in the Middle Ages (until 1602) to the same diocese as Vadstena, i.e. to the diocese of Linkoping. 8, On the use of beata and sancta with regard to Birgitta see Andren, De septem sacr., pp. 88-91; Bergh 86 f.; Bergh V 20, 28 f., Undhagen 119 f.; id., NTBB, 44 (1 957) P. 33; below, p. 219, n. 19.

The texts sub- sequent to the rubric, according to directions in the MS. are to be added to the following Rev.: I 3, 13, 16,17, z3, 28, 32; II 2; III 12, 13, 19, 22, 33; /V 16, 17, 23, 32, 34, 51, 52,5 55, 68, 71,6 81, 93, 102, 107, 113, 114, 122, 125, 127.7 There- after follows the text of Rev. IV 131 (according to Gh) about which the scribe notes in the left margin on f. 155v: in fine quarti libri scripta fuit.8 The remaining supplements are to Rev. VI 3, 5, 9, 1o, 15-20, 28, 3o, 31, 35, 36, 39, 41, 52, 75, 98.9 This collection of supplement texts would seem to have been copied direct from a collection that Prior Petrus is supposed to have given to the brothers of the Cloister of Vadstena.10 As far as the supplements to Rev. I-VI 98 are concerned, I see no reason to doubt that it was these very supplements that in 1380 were first entered in a copy of the so-called Liber Alphonsill belonging to the cloister. Other supplement texts were gradually added until the Revelations acquired the extent and order they have in Gh.12 As is evident from the above, Ua contains all the Decl. to Rev. I.13 The text of these differs in some cases from that in other manuscripts and in the printed editions. This points to certain revisions having been carried out when the copy of the Liber Alphonsi in Vadstena was enlarged by these Decl.14 4 A piece of f. 143, on which the supplied letters may be assumed to have been written, is missing. By regula confirmata is meant the Constituciones of the Birgittine Order which Pope Urban VI confirmed on 3rd Dec. 1378; see pp. 2 f., n. 12 and (K) p. II0, footnotes 72 and 74. Concerning litteris bullatis super indulgenciis, which are also mentioned in the rubric, see Hojer 97 if. 5 In Gh this supplement has been incorporated into the chapter text. It there corresponds to Rev. IV 52 E-F; cf. K, p. 107, n. 32; above, p. 2, n. 6. 6 Remarkably enough Hollman 36, n. 1, gives that the manuscript both contains and lacks this supplement ! The original reading in the manuscript (f. 153v) was cxxix, which was then corrected to cxxvij. The entered supplement corresponds to Add. IV 127+129 in Gh. 8 Cf. (K) p. 106, n. 24. Of Decl. VI 98 only the first half is found (to in multis vani <tatibus>incl.) in the manuscript. 10 See above, footnote 3, and pp. 27 ff.; Hollman 28 ff., 113-115 (the prologues to Extray.); Wessen XVIII f., XXXVIII f. n See above, pp. 17 if., 96, 106, io8 f. 12 That Ua lacks certain supplements has early been noticed, since in connection with certain supplements a hand, seemingly contemporaneous with that which entered the collection, made notes of the type deficit hic (+ a reference sign on f. 144r, in the left margin before Decl. III 12. What is missing are the supplements to Rev. III io and II), plures sunt hic ponende declaraciones (in the left margin on f. 158v in conjunction with Decl. VI 3o; cf. K, p. io8 f., n. 48 and n. 54). Amongst the supplements that are to be found in Gh but are missing from Ua and most other manuscripts may be mentioned Decl. V int. 16; cf. Bergh V 72 f. 13 Kraft's assertion (pp. 76 and 92 f., n. 2; cf. 71, n. z) that Decl. I 3 was not entered by Prior Petrus but was inserted in Vadstena just before the text was printed in 1492, is contradicted by its presence in Ua and a few other manuscripts (see above, F, P. 94, n. 52.) 14 See below, pp. 217ff. 
 
 
 
 
 I15 Mb = Uppsala, Universitetsbiblioteket, MS. C 243, a. 1497, if. 66r-94v (96). Lit.: Andersson—Schmitt p. 25; Annerstedt II, 327; Hollman 48; Maliniemi 131; Westman 27o. This fragmentary manuscript consists of 96 paper leaves. It has no outside covers. It has earlier belonged to Vadstena Cloister where it was written down by a monk called Michael Nicolail in 1497 (see below). Of the Birgittine texts it only contains Rev. I—II 3: 24 Scindemus entered on the following pages:2 if. 66r-94v: Rev. I (with text rubrics). The book ends with Explicit liber primus anno domini 1497 • die 17 nouembris. The Incipit completely agrees with that in Gh (see the crit. app. of this ed., p. 241). The chapters in Book I are divided into paragraphs (a, b, c, etc.) coinciding with Gh. All the declaraciones are included, all of them clearly marked as such; namely, Decl. 3, 13, 16, 17, 23, 28, 32. Mb is, as far as I am aware, the only manuscript that contains the text of Decl. 3: Io—ii; this text seems to have first appeared in Gh.3 The variant readings, additions and exclusions that are characteristic of Gh are also found in Mb, e.g. Decl. 3, 32 Iste] Iste docturus sponsam christi Gh Mb; 52, 47 aruina, que] adeps qui Gh Mb. The concordance indicated between Gh and Mb is most simply explained if we assume that Mb is a transcription of the 5 years older Gh, the editio princeps.4 Whatever the case may be Mb is without significance for my edition.' ff. 95r-96°: Rev.

Lit.: Fischer 498 f.; Montag 101, n. 4. This manuscript has originally belonged to a (Cistercian) monastery in Heil- bronn6 in Bavaria; this can be read in a provenance note on f. 251", presumably entered during the 1400's: liber monasterij in Fontesalutis. Three scribes have shared the work of transcribing the manuscript: ff. has been written by a certain Henrik from Salzburg,' ff. 12-251 by Johannes "Goldpen" and Konrad from Nuremberg (see below). 1 That the handwriting in Mb is that of Michael Nicolai 1516) has been shown by Maliniem 131; cf. ib. 133, 138; Silfverstolpe 1 44• 2 On the rest of the contents of the manuscript see Andersson—Schmitt pp. 36, 38 f., 46, 57, 6o f., 8o, 82. 3 See pp. 94, n. 52; 217 f. 4 See pp. 1 ff. Hollman 48 has stated, after a hasty examination of Mb, that it may be a tran- scription of Gh. 5 Some errors in Gh that have been considered to be misprints have been corrected by the monk who wrote Mb; e.g. 32, 5 where an erroneous animi has been altered to enim (see p. 331), and 55, 63 where Gh has Labrantes, Mb (and F) has Laborantes. However, the correct reading in this latter case should be Laboratores; see the crit. app. These corrections obviously are no objec- tion to Gh having been the original of Mb; cf. pp. 138; 219-221. 6 See e.g. LTK, 5, 147; cf.

 117 Munich since 1876, originally belonged to an Augustine monastery in Ratisbon2 where the above-mentioned Johannes Myrow was probably a monk. A certain Nicolaus Rosinberg seems at one time to have owned the manuscript.2 Numerous corrections of the text entered by several different hands in the text itself as well as in the margins show that the scribe was not particulary meticulous in his work. On the fly-leaf an alphabetical table of contents was begun in the hope that some monk would continue and finish it.3 The manuscript has the following contents: f.

In the MS. itself there is in the lower margin of f. 1 r the following note of provenance: Ad Augustinenses Ratisbonenses; concerning the Augustine hermits and their monastery—founded in 1267—in Ratisbon see J. Staber, Kirchengeschichte des Bistums Regensburg, Regensburg, 1966, pp. 65 f., 78, 174.—Westman 265 states, incorrectly, that M be- longed to the Augustine monastery in Munich. This probably arises from a misunderstanding of the information given in Halm—Meyer, loc. cit. Kraft 73, footnote 2, asserts that the manuscript was transcribed by a monk in the Bavarian monastery of Rosinberg. This assertion is based on a misinterpretation of information in the Explicit on f. 36I' where, according to Kraft, after Deo gracias (see above), there follows: "Claus (tro ?) Rosinberg". In fact there is laus Rosinberg. The C in Claus (tro is Kraft's own addition) is not a C but a part of the Q in the word Qvia, which can be read on f. 36o", line 27 and which constitutes the beginning of leccio III of the Sabbath (= Cap. XXI in Gh) in SA. Kraft's misreading arises from the fact that, against his better judgement, he has interpreted a part of the text on f. 36o" as belonging to f. 361 the lower corner of which has been torn out of the manuscript. Before laus, in my opinion, Nico should be added, thus giving the Christian name Nicolaus. As support for this I refer the reader to a note on the lower margin of f. 48r where there is in the manuscript: N Rosinberg, where N is most probably to be considered as an abbreviation of Nicolaus. Probably this Nicolaus Rosinberg has once owned the manuscript. Who he was, I do not know. 3 This is apparent from the following note at the foot of the same leaf: nota. vt occasio daretur deuoto fratri inceptum est hic registrum secundunz ordinem alphabeti. prosequatur et compleat qui potest. Published and commented on by Undhagen in Eranos, LXVII (1969), 81-143, on the basis of M, F and T5. The same acrostic was later found by the editor in another two MSS., Cb and Db; see Undhagen, Deux manuscrits ; cf. below, pp. 13o and 203. The same Extray. is found handed down through Cb, q and Ta; see (q) p. 135, footn. 4. 6 See Fb p. 206; cf. p. 226. Has originally been fatebuntur; cf.

The other 211 leaves are divided into 18 quires and have been foliated in modern times. Before this was done the manuscript seems to have had two more leaves, namely those between ff. 2 and 3 resp. 4 and 5. These two leaves most probably contained the rubrics to Rev. II 17-30, III 1-18 (beginning) and IV 62-96, which are all missing from the lists of rubrics. The text has been entered in two columns per page by one hand which seems also to have made certain corrections. The initials at the begin- ning of the chapters have not been filled in. It would seem that the manuscript, which lacks information as to when it was written, can be dated to the first half of the 1400's.1 It has earlier belonged to the famous Farnese family.2 Because of (211 + Cf.

That it was written after Birgitta's canonization in 13 91 I consider to be certain as Birgitta is called sancta throughout the lists of rubrics; see below (Contents, ff. i ra_2rb ) ; p 219, n. 19. 2 This is given on a loose leaf which has been put into the manuscript in modern times. I examined this manuscript when visiting Naples in 1962. The Biblioteca Nazionale was founded in 1734 by King Charles III of Bourbon who in that year donated to the library among other things a large collection of manuscripts that he had inherited as son of Phillip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnes e. Most of these manuscripts had previously belonged to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who later became Pope Paul III (1534-1549). They were originally kept in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome where the library, Biblioteca Farnesiana, occupied no less than five rooms of the first floor in the middle of the seventeenth century. For further information on this and other relevant questions see DE, I, 1068 f., III, 54 f.; a IX, 53-55, XIV, 825, XXIV, 254, XXVI, 234; G. Guerrieri, Il fondo Farnesiano (=I Quaderni della R.

 I19 this I first thought that N was identical with the "Codex Farnesianus" that Durante mentions and gives readings from already in his edition of the Revelations from 1606.3 However, after comparing these readings with the corresponding text in N I have had to conclude that there can be no question of their not being the same manuscript—providing Durante has given the readings correctly.4 On the other hand it is perfectly obvious that N and "Codex Farnesianus" are very closely related. This is evident from the fact that both these manuscripts show a consider- able number of errores coniunctivi compared to other manuscripts; for example, Rev. 6: 3 diaboli membra instead of diabolos, 32: 1 o in ignem eternum cum diabolo instead of in eternum diabolo. The nature of the errors in these manuscripts leads us to suspect that they have been copied from a common exemplar, the interpolated and contaminated text of which has been further revised in transcription. Of supplementary material only Decl. I 13 and 16 plus Decl. II 2 are found. Contents ff. Ire,-2`'b: List of the rubrics in Rev.

Among the more prominent superintendents of the Birgitta House was Olaus Magnus who lived in exile in Italy from 1537 and who was appointed archbishop in 1544 by the above-mentioned Paul III. Using the printing-press he had established in the Birgitta House he published among other things a new edition of the Revelations in 1557. Durante's Rome edi- tion of 1606 is based on this very edition; see above, p. 4 with n. 22. On the Birgitta House in Rome see S. Nordmark, 'Den heliga Birgittas hus i Rom nu och fordom', in Credo, i6 (1935), PP. 129-134, 16o-162, 193-199; S. Sibilia, La casa di S. Brigida in Piazza Farnese a Roma, Roma, 1960; Collijn, Birgittinska gestalter, 13-17; on Olaus Magnus see, for example, H. Grape, Olaus Magnus, Stock- holm, 1970 (esp. pp. 84-95). 3 See above, p. 4. In Ad lectorem praefatio Durante states that this manuscript was kept in the Farnesiana Bibliotheca of which he himself was, for many years, head librarian, thanks to the illustrious Odoardo Farnese's great benevolence (in Farnesiana Bibliotheca asseruatur [sc. codex Farnesianus], cui multis ego abhinc annis Illustrissimi Odoardi Farnesij mumficentia ac liberalitate praesuin ...). Odoardo Farnese was cardinal 1591-1626; see DE, I, 1069. 4 See Hollman 20-26.

The text has been entered by two scribes, one of whom has written ff. I r-317r, the other ff. 317v-323v. Chapter rubrics appear almost exclusively in Rev. I (see below). There is no information as to the date of the manuscript. It is certain, however, that it was written after Birgitta's canonization on 7th October I 3 91 which is mentioned on f. 322va (see below).

 122 S = Stockholm, Kungliga Biblioteket, MS. A 66, a. 1418, ff. I (239). Lit.: Bergh 62, 64 f., 68-70, 76; Coilijn, Birgittautstiillningen, 126 f.; Hollman 47; Kraft 71, 78, 81, footnote 3; Lehmann, NTBB, 24 (1937), 149; Westman 265. This MS. consists of 239 leaves of size 30,7 X 22 cm. About 2/3 of them are of paper, the rest of parchment. The following can be said about its history and prove- nance. It was written in Neisse' and was completed on the Saturday before 29th August 1418. This is apparent from a note at the end of the MS. on f. 230r: De huius libri complecione Gloria laus et honor tibi sit rex christe redemptor et glorie laudes promo tue genitrici cuius adiutorio libri sunt scripta2 finita Anno domini M° cccc xvizj° Sabbato ante festum Decollacionis sancti johannis in Estuario domus notarij Ciuitatis Nise.1 With the help of a note entered on the inner-side of the front cover, we can conclude that the MS. belonged to the famous Cistercian monastery at Leubus: 3 liber sancte Marie uirginis in lube;7s4 Celestium reuelacionum domine Brigitte. Later—when I do not know—S came to Lyon, where it was bought at an auction in 1891 for the Kungliga biblioteket in Stockholm. The text, which is entered in 2 columns per page, has been written by the same scribe throughout and has the following contents: ff. ra— ea : Prol. M.: Stupor ...fatebantur. There are no rubrics, Incipit or Explicit. Column title: liber primus. Rev. I (without rubrics).6 A list of rubrics to Rev. I has been entered at the end of the manuscript (see below). The Decl., which have been attached to chs. 13, 16, 17, 23, z8, 32, are not marked as declaracio. There is neither Incipit nor Explicit. Column title: primus liber. 34"-55": Rev. II (with text rubrics except for ch. 2). jncipit Secundus liber. There is no Explicit. Ch. 2 has the same short Decl. as Fb, q and certain other manuscripts.' ff. 55"--219": Rev. III—VIII (with text rubrics; the ES is missing). if. 2 9va_230r: SA (with the rubrics entered after the text on ff. 229vb-23or). ff. 231r-232ra.: Short table of contents: Quicumque legere desiderat de materys infrascriptis inueniet eas in libris et capitulis subnotatis ff. z34': The town of Neisse (in Polish Nysa, Nisa), which was founded in the 13th century, lies in Ober- schlesien about 7o km south—south—east of Breslau; see, for example, LTK, 7, 872 f.; Oesterley, op. cit., 473. 2 Lehmanns reading scripti (NTBB, 24, 149) is incorrect. Leubus is situated about 40 km north—north—west of Breslau. The monastery, which was founded around 1175, was the oldest and most important Cistercian monastery in Silesia; see, for example, LTK, 6, 989 (with ref.); cf. Heimbucher I, 336, 349; K. Loftier, Deutsche Klosterbiblio- theken, Bonn u. Leipzig, 1922, p. oo; Oesterley, op cit., 391. 4 Lehmann, who has misinterpreted the word as Lubene, states (NTBB, 24, 149) that the manu- script comes from the town of Liiben (lying about 70 km north—north—west of Breslau); on the name Lubens see, for example, Graesse—Benedict 179 s.v. Leobusium ; cf. LTK, 6, 989; Oesterley, op cit., 391. 5 This is apparent from a penciled note on the inner-side of the front cover. Ch. 40 has by mistake been numbered xxxix and thus the succeeding chapters are a unit too low. 7 See Fb p. 206, n. 18.

(N° 261o); Westman 272. This MS. consists of 322 paper leaves, 29,5 X 21,5 cm in size. The text is entered in two columns per page by one hand. The manuscript was completed on 27th Nov. 1 417 according to the Explicit after SA, f. 322' : . . . Et sic consequenter finis est tocius huius libri celestium reuelacionum beate qui est brigitte reuelatus. Qui et anno domini M° cccc xvii° Jn vigilia aduentus domini extitit terminatus et cempletus deo gracias. According to von Heinemann III, 308, W most probably originates from a monas- tery in Hildesheirn, perhaps from Woltingerode. The Revelation text we find in W—and g which seems to be a transcript of W—has, as I shall show, been subject to such an extensive revision that the manu- script must be considered worthless for reconstructing the original Revelation text. I shall therefore merely give a brief resume of its contents which are the following: ff. 1"-2rb: List of the rubrics to Rev. I: Ad honorem summi patris ... Primus liber continet in incipiunt rubrice sigillatim per ordinem.1 se lx capitula ff. 2rb_4.ra: Prol. M.: Jncipit prologus editus per ... magistrunz li/latheum (o) de Swecia Stupor ... fatebantur. There is no Explicit. ff. 4ra-34th: Rev. I (without text rubrics). Decl. 13, 16, 17, 23, 28 and 32 are found incorpo- rated with the text of these chapters. Thus none of these supplements is marked as declaracio. There then follow Rev. II—VII without text rubrics (each book is, however, preceded by a list of rubrics), ES (8 chs. with text rubrics), Rev. VIII without text rubrics but preceded by a list of rubrics, Vita sine legenda beate Brigitte (ff. 28913-306rb)2 and SA. As regards the disposition of the Revelation books and the supplementary material, W on the whole agrees with Fb and K (see pp. 206-209, 104—III). See p. 226. On this famous hymn called Jubilus, the authorship of which is not ascribed to Bernard by scholars of the present day, see Szoverffy II, 78 ff. (with references). See p. 226. 2 This Vita, which begins Sicut legimus de sancto johanne and ends sanata est Deo gracias. Explicit vita beate brigitte de regno swede, is also found in g and represents the same version as the so-called Pa-vita, the majority of which has been published by Collijn in A&P, 614-640, principally on the basis of "Cod. olim Laurentii in Panisperna" written in 1378. It is clear from A&P, 640, n. 2, that the end of this vita is found in the above-mentioned Panisperna-manuscript, ff. 22v-23r; cf. A&P, pp. XXI—XXVI; Ekwall 14-16, 78 ff.; Hollman 85 ff.; Undhagen XXIII, 81-92; above, pp. 4 f., n. Ia. 8 9 
 
 
 
 
 124 Bibliotheque Royale, MS. 2099, a. 1490, ff. 47ra-92va (292). Lit: van den Gheyn III (1903), 290 f. It is clear from the Explicit on f. 264vb that this manuscript is of a late date, having been completed on the 23rd June 1490 only two years before Gh, the editio princeps. The Explicit reads: Ad honorem Dei omnipotentis et virginis Marie matrisque nostre sancte birgitte presentes quattuor primi libri celestium reuelationum cum suis defensiuis Anno domini Millesimo quadringentesimo Nonagesimo Jn vigilia Natalis sanctissimi Ioannis baptiste feliciter expliciunt. The contents of Ba, which comprises 292 paper leaves 28,7 X 20,5 cm, mainly cover Rev. I—IV, as is evident from the cited Explicit. But after every book there follows an account of those passages (articuli) in the respective books that have been criticized by the Basle synod, plus the statements made by the foremost defenders on these articuli.1 This is an arrangement I have not found in any other manuscript.

Ad honorem ... per ordinem ut sequitur.4 The 6o rubrics are unnumbered except for the first, which is marked primunz. ff. 2ra-3': Prol.

The remainder of ch. 38 and the rest of Rev. I is missing. Since the rubrics to all 6o chapters have been entered in the list of rubrics above, there is reason to suppose that also the text of these chapters was originally included in the manuscript. 'Thus probably after f. 17 a number of leaves have been lost. There are no text rubrics at all. Cathedral Chapter Library, MS. 114, a. 1409, ff. 5va_7vb (11 4 ). Lit.: Woolley 8o-8z. Into this parchment manuscript consisting of 114 leaves1 a miscellaneous collection of texts has been gathered. Besides the Birgittine texts that are found at the beginning of the MS. there are works by, for instance, Bernhard of Clair- vaux, Pseudo-Origines and Thomas ab Aquino.2 On the inside of the front cover there is an ex libris stating: liber sancte marie lincolniensis; i.e., the MS. earlier belonged to a Maria convent in Lin- coln. Woolley dates the MS. to the I400's. However, with the aid of the follow- ing Explicit, f. 48vb, entered after the Defensorium by Cardinal Adam Easton (see below), we can establish a more exact date of origin: Explicit defensorium beate birgitte per manus Ludolphi alphordie Anna dominj M° quadringentesimo ix° feria tercia post dominicam quasimodogeniti. This defensorium has thus been entered in the manuscript by a certain Ludolphus in Alford3 who completed the transcrip- tion on the Tuesday following the first Sunday after Easter in the year 1409. Since the same scribe seems to have written Prol. M., ff. sva_ivb, there is reason to believe that also this text, which concerns us most nearly in this connection, should be dated to 1409. Of the contents of Ga the following are of greatest interest to us: Ga = Lincoln, ff. 5 va —7vb: Prol. M.: JNcipit prologus in libros celestium Reuelacionum beate birgitte sponse christi de swecia ... per infinita secula seculorum. Amen Sequitur prologus. Stupor ... fatebuntur. Explicit prologus. In the unusually long text to the Incipit, Magister Mathias is presented in some detail and the reader is referred to Rev. V int. 16, VI 89 and 75 as 4 5 Cf. e.g. Fb p. 206. de swecia seems to have been crossed out later. A later hand has changed mathiam to matheum. Cf. Fb p. 206. It has most probably had more leaves at the end as the concluding text is imperfect. 2 See Woolley 81 f. Today a small market town in Lincolnshire, England.

 130 by a certain Johannes Gepserl and has, it appears, been written by a certain. Dominican brother called Johannes Reyffer.2 The MS., which is without informa- tion concerning its date of origin, has been dated by Schmidt 201 to the beginning of the Ives. As Ta seems to be the original of Cb, which was written in 14413, we have in this date a terminus ante quem for Ta. Of the 162 leaves in the manuscript only some are numbered and these in modern times. Contents f.

 131 b = Berlin, Staatsbibliothek der Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz, MS. theol. Lat. fol. 262, a. 1445, ff. 24ra-55ra (176). Lit.: Bergh 63, 67 ff.; Godel 28; Rose 892-894 (N° 821); Undhagen 58 f.; Westman 266. This manuscript, which in Rose is denoted by no. 821, really consists of two parts, MS. theol. fol. 262 and 263, respectively. Part I has been written by two different hands, part II by the first hand in part I. At the beginning of each part the following provenance note is entered on f. I r, apparently in handwriting from the i600's: Ex libris Fratrum S. Mariae ad Arborem in Clivia. Thus the manuscript, like cod. B, has previously belonged to the Birgittine convent of Marienboem in Cleve.' Judging by the information on f. 23rb the MS. seems to have been completely written in 1445 (see below). Therefore it cannot have been written in Marienboem since this convent was not founded until 1460.1 It may possibly have originated in Marienwater, the mother convent of Marienboem.2 A relatively detailed presentation of the contents of b has been given by Rose and Undhagen.3 Of its contents only the following need be mentioned here: ff. 6ra_23rb: Alphabetical table of contents to the Revelations beginning ABbas bonus ... and ending Xristianorum status ...4 after which follows this note entered in the same hand as the table of contents: Et sic est finis huius tabule deo gracias semper. Anno domini 1445 septimo kalendas ffebruarij luna 18. The table was thus completed on 26th January 1445 which fell 17 days after the last full moon.4 Presumably the rest of the contents were written in the same year. ff. 24 ra — 25": Prol. .111.: Hic est titulus huius libri qui celestium reuelacionum christi ad sponsam suam beatam birgittam liber intitulatur. AD honorem summi patris eiusdemque flu matris.

After which follows, under the rubric Contra 1 See p. 171 with footn. 4. On f. tr (central margin) is the stamp of BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIO- NALE. Thus the MS. has for some time belonged to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. I imagine it was acquired at the beginning of the 19th century from Jean-Baptiste Maugerard, notorious for having stolen a large number of MSS. from monasteries, among others from Marienboem; see K. Loftier, Deutsche Klosterbibliotheken, 2. Aufl., Bonn u. Leipzig, 1922, pp. 73 ff., 77 ff.; Loftier— Kirchner—Olbrich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, II, 426; Leyh, Handbuch der Bibliothekswissen- schaft, III: z, 720; III: 2, 49, 53, 76 f.. 134 f. ▪ See below (cod. B), p. 173 with footnote 13. 3 Undhagen, who has used this MS.—under the designation t—for his edition of Archbishop Birger Gregersson's Birgitta Office, has shown that the manuscript that is the basis for the edition of "Vita S. Birgittae" in AS, Oct., Tom. IV (i868), 485-495, must without doubt have been copied from cod. b (t); see Undhagen 149-151. 4 Cf. below (B), pp. 172, 174• • On the use of "Mondalter" in medieval datings see Bresslau II, 405 f.; Grotefend I, 127. s On this rubric see p. 226.

This manuscript consists of 343 paper leaves, 32 X 21,5 cm in size. The first few leaves have been damaged by water. The content of g is identical with that of W (see p. 123), which has almost certainly been the original of g. The Explicit after SA, f. 343ra, is word for word the same as in W (see p. 123) except for the date which in g reads: m° • cccc lxix° altera die post ascensionis domini. Thus the manuscript was completed on 12th May 1469. After this Explicit there is a short table of contents in Latin which was, according to information in the manuscript, entered in 1727 by J. F. Reimmann, superintendent of Hildesheim.1 The manu- script was transferred from his library in 1788 to Gottingen. h = Stockholm, Kungliga Biblioteket, MS. A 70 a, cent. XV late, ‘ff. Ira 45vb (169 ).

(N° 24437). Like cod. s,6 1 originates from Erfurt, since, judging by the provenance note in the upper margin of f. ,r (Cartusiw Erfordiensis), the manuscript initially belonged to the library of the Carthusian monastery (Salvatorberg)7 in this town. In the lower margin of the same page there is another provenance note entered later: "Bibl. Biilov. BeyTern. III. 22 b." Thus cod. 1 has then belonged to the well-known bibliophile, Lord Justice Friedrich Gottlieb Julius von Billow (1760-1831), who possessed a large library in his castle of Beyernaumburg near Sangerhausen. Many of the manuscripts in this library had been acquired when, with others, the monastery in Erfurt was secularized in 1803. After von Billow's death his manu- scripts were sold by auction in 1836.8 A number of these were bought by a former pupil of the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788-1856)9 who had See Hollman, loc.cit. See Undhagen 52 if. 2 This is apparent from the provenance notes in cod. A 7o a (on f. ir in the upper margin: Car- thusiae in Buxheim) and in A 7o (on f. ir in the upper margin: Jste Tiber est Carthusiensis in Buchs- heim prope Memmingen).

After Sir William Hamilton's death his sons gave the manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, which received them in 1857.1 The contents of 1, which on the whole agree with those of s and Hb,2 cover 248 paper leaves with two columns per page and numbered in Roman numerals.

 135 numbered xi, and f. 17, the verso page numbered xxvi, 14 leaves have been lost containing an extensive section of Rev. I (see below). Further 16 leaves are missing between ff. 204 and 205—the verso pages of which are numbered as ccini and ccxxi respectively. The missing leaves have contained more than 3o chapters of Rev. VI (see below). The older numbering of the leaves, which was most probably done at the same time as the transcription,' begins on f. 6v ( = i) and continues to f. 267v ( = cclxxx); during the numbering leaves containing a list of rubrics have generally not been numbered. There is no information about the date of origin and provenance of the manu- script. A note at the end (f. 279va) may indicate that it belonged to a certain Duke Ludwig: lodwycus dei gracia dux. The presence of addiciones and declara- ciones shows that q came into existence at the earliest in 1380.2 Other factors indicate that it may have been written earlier than the closely related cod. Fb which is dated to 1386.3 In the upper margin of f. 4r there is • B • 28, presumably a previous manuscript mark.

The words scismatis quod hodie videmus etc. allude, of course, to the Great Schism 1378-1414.

According to the Explicit' on f. 164ra s was completed in August 1424. The scribe, who calls himself Johannes of Gotha2, was presumably a monk in the famous Benedictine monastery of St. Peter in Erfurt from where the manuscript originates.3 After the secularization of the monastery in 1803 its manuscripts were dispersed in different directions. Cod. s found its way to Bibliotheca Balowiana in the castle of Beyernaumburg near Sangerhausen.4 In 1836 it was sold by auction to the well-known antiquarian Gustav Klemm (1802-1867), librarian at the Konigliche Bibliothek in Dresden.5 In 1873 it was acquired by auction in Dresden by the Kungliga Biblioteket, Stockholm.6 The contents of s agree almost exactly with those of I with which it is closely related: ff.

II—VIII (usually without text rubrics).12 The relationships within the 3 family are far more difficult to analyze than those within the y group. Certain groupings can, however, be made. In order to facilitate the work of classification I shall first discuss some of the manuscripts that can be eliminated;' namely Mb W g. Mb Youngest of all the a MSS. is Alb, written in 1497. As pointed out earlier, its immediate original would seem to have been Gh, the editio princeps. Apart, for example, from the mistakes I have already mentioned above (p. 1'5), the following errors are common to Gh and Mb: Rev. 18, 35 umquam talia ulterius] vlterius talia Gh Mb; 19, 23 nisi] nisi ad Gh Mb; 27, 45 tunc om. Gh Mb; 32, 23 post inquit add. Christus Gh Mb. Since Mb seems to be a copy of Gh it can be eliminated. Thus hereafter the readings in Mb are not mentioned. These usually agree with those in Gh. W—g The revelation text we find in W and g diverges conspicuously from that of the other manuscripts. In fact it has been subjected to such heavy revision that we ought to consider it as a completely new recension, indeed in part as a completely new text. A few examples will suffice to illustrate this circumstance: Rev. I, 7 ego] ego sum alpha et o W g; 2: 9 considera, quia Deus tuus precedit te, quem serui et amici reliquerunt in terra, quia non amicos terrenos quesiui, sed celestes] considera, que dominus deus tuus fecit et sustinuit in paupertate nec amicos terrestres quesiuit sed celestes, non diuites elegit sed pauperes W g; 3: 5 ad hoc, ut interficiatur filius eius] ut filios suos interficiat W g; 5, 6o sq. Si velit dare nobis voluntatem nostram, sufficit nobis, et habeat ipse regnum suum et celum] Si velit nos saluare, saluabimur. Sufficit nobis, ut det nobis perficere voluntatem nostram et habeat ipse regnum suum W g; 31: 6 Nec purissima (XVIII verba) om. W g. There is no doubt that W, written in 1417,2 was the immediate original of g, written in 1469.3 For this reason the latter manuscript can be eliminated; nor has " This is also the case in D Q Hb h 1; see p. I16 , n. 9. 12 After Rev. VIII another scribe has entered two short non-Birgittine passages; these are found reprinted in Lehmann, NTBB, 23, pp. 14 f.

 139 its original any value in establishing the text. Thus the readings from the specific W g group will generally not be given below. DQh1sK D Q h 1 s K stand out as a separate group among the 3 manuscripts, being characterized by a large number of common errors; for example, Rev. 5, 68 sicut fures om. D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 3 I . 12 inter hec septem lilia, que erant (ante in) om. D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua q); 40: 7 Hanc autem superfluitatem inuenit superbia, que nunc habetur et diligitur pro lege (post nature) om. D Q h 1 s K (deest Da Ga Ha Ua); Prol. M., 121 ipsis] hiis (vel hijs) D Q h 1 s K (deest Ha Ua); 148 operum (Open/ M)] ipsam D Q h 1 s K (deest Ha Ua); 199 quod (explic.)] vt D Q h 1 s K (deest Ha Ua); Rev. 5, 63 uno verbo] in vno puncto D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 10, 97 duceretur] sic duceretur D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 54, 10o salua] libera D Q h 1 s K (deest Da Ga Ua). Each one of the manuscripts D Q h 1 K contains such errors that none of them can have served as the original of any of the others within the group. Such errors, for example, are: Prol. M.: 34 si tamen ipse velit, quantum in ipso est, ad hec operari om. D; Rev. 5, 14 omnes om. Q; 32, 55 licet om. Q; 4, 17 spiritum om. h; 31, 32 iugiter om. h; Prol. M., 77 sine om. 11 absque in m. 11; 204 per eundemreligiosum] ab eodem religioso 1; Rev. 31, 44 ultra] super 1; I, 29 suggerendo om. K; 19, 28 com- muniter om. K; 59, 82 sq. Qui ... velamento (XV verba post velamine) om. K. As for s, it contains most of the errors found in 1, for example, Prol. M: 7 veritatis ... auertat, vel (X verba) om. 1 s; Rev. 44: 3 ex caritate monendo in prophetis, pre- dicando per me t:psum, paciendo pro ipsis (predicando ... ipsis om. D Q h K). Non curant, quid feci om. 1 s (post quid feci); I, 55 de me p D Q h K N Ha q1 (a me y 3 exc. DQhlsKNIlacf)] igne diuino 1 s; 5, 64 contra] super 1 s. I have found no error in s that is not also to be found in 1. On the other hand, as is clear from the above examples, 1 has certain errors not found in s. Consequently I think it is highly probable that 1 was copied from s,4 for which reason it can be eliminated. Thus if 1 is a transcription of s, the earliest date that can be assigned to it is 1424, when s was written.5 Evidence of the close relationship between D Q h 1 s is provided by the fact that these five manuscripts all lack text rubrics to chs. 56-6o in Rev. 1.6 The following errors are also common to these manuscripts: Rev. 54, 10o quia to solum om. D Q h 1 s (quia solum om. K); 32, 3o nempe (namque e J R Sa)] quippe D Q h 1 s; 6o, 9 scire debes] scias D Q h 1 s. 4 Cf. Bergh 65-69 who, using the text of Rev. VII as starting-point, has come to the conclusion that1 and s derive from a common original. Eklund—Leby lean towards the same conclusion although the relations in the text of SA seem rather to point to 1 having been copied from S. 5 See above, p. 137. 6 See above, pp. 116, 120, 133, 134, 138; a later hand has entered text rubrics to chs. 58 and 59 in Q; see above, p. 120, footn. 2. 
 
 
 
 
 140 D Q h contain a number of common errors that may indicate that these three manuscripts reproduce the same original, for example, Rev. 19, 32 namque (enim p2)] autem D Q h om. 1 s. The errors common to D Q h 1 s K must have originated in a source common to all these manuscripts. Closest to this source is K, the text of which has not been subjected to such extensive revision as that of D Q h and—to an even greater extent—s1. The mutual relationships within the group of manuscripts treated here may be illustrated by the following stemma: NHaq—DQhlsK Closely related to the D Q h 1 s K group are NHaq. Common to these nine manuscripts are, for instance, the following errors: Rev. 1, 28 hominis om. N Ha ql DQhlsK; 1, 34 ideo om. N Ha cilD Qh1 sK; 2, 34 quod yetis OM. N Ha cjilD Qh1sK; I, 20 frequencius] crebrius NEP q1 DQh1sli; 1, 3o sit] estNilace D Qhls K. As was mentioned above (p. 128), Ha contains only chs. 1-3, 13 datis retribuere in Rev. I. Prol. M. is also missing from this manuscript. It seems to me both im- possible and unnecessary to try and define the relationship of this manuscript on the basis of this small section of text. The following error gives an indication of its imperfect quality: 1, 47 iterum pro ea, si possibile esset] semel Ha. As shown above (p. 139), each one of the manuscripts D Q h 1 s K contains errors of such a nature that we must exclude the possibility that any of these manuscripts could have served as the original of any one of the manuscripts N Ha q. It is quite obvious that the fragmentary and prolifically erroneous manu- script W cannot have been the original of any of the other manuscripts. The same applies to N, in which can be found numerous errores separativi as compared to D Q h 1 s K and other manuscripts; for example, 1: 13 Ego sum verus propheta om. N; 32: 17 cuius malicia est michi om. N (deest q); 5: 16 audire vel] dicere verita- tem et N; 56, 29 meum (mecum 1 R meos y Fl [?] K sr)] seruire michi N. With regard to q's relationship to D Q h 1 s K and NW, the above examples show that it is the ql readings which reveal the dependence of the manuscript on a presumptive source common to this group of manuscripts. q —M STa The immediate original of q seems to have been a manuscript closely connected 
 
 
 
 
 141 with D Q h 1 s K. This can be supported by further examples of separative errors common to these manuscripts, such as the following: Prol. M., 18o eosdem amicos meos (meos om. j1 La)] eos cilE0QhlsKGa (deest Ha Ua Mb); Rev. 5, 16 ait om. ql D Q h 1 s K (and Ka deest Ga Ha Ua); 5, 27 a (in P om. m)] ex ce D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 5, 29 ideo om. q1 D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 5, 77 quod (consec.)] vt ql D Q h 1 s K (deest Ga Ha Ua); 39: 6 propter timorem mei (meum R Aa y M2 hominum N) om. ql D Q h 1 s K (deest Da Ga W Us). In these cases q2 , as in the examples given above, corrected the errors shared by ql and D Q h 1 s K (N Ha). Whether these corrections were found already entered in the manu- script from which q was copied or whether they were made in q with the help of a special corrective original is difficult to determine. Neither alternative need preclude the other. It is clear that q—directly or indirectly—was dependent upon at least two sources, of which the principal one must be assumed to have been close to the source from which the D Q h 1 s K group derives. The most im- portant secondary source of q was probably a manuscript within the a group and particularly closely connected with M S Ta, a sub-group within the 8 tradition, with which q shares, for instance, the following errors: Prol. 'VI., 49 mala] multa (inulta S) q M1 Ta (and Pa); Rev. 10, 156 0 Pater (Pater Pa) om. q M S Ta (and Da ja). The influence of the secondary source of q manifests itself here and there in the manuscript. Apart from the above-cited examples may be mentioned Rev. I 29 where ql D Q h 1 s K N Ha and f3 have the reading proprio which has been replaced by meo in q2. This latter reading is also found in the a manuscripts M S Ta Da ja Paw g F Ba as well as in y (deest X w) and Gh. That M S Ta form a separate group amongst the 8 manuscripts is shown, for instance, by the following errors common to these manuscripts: Prol. M., 55 a defensione iusticie] ad se ostendendum uel pusillanimis a iusticie defensione (defensione iusticie S) M S Ta (cfr Prol. M., 5o sq.); Rev. 5, 22 et homo om. M1- S Ta; 5, 56 siciunt (sciunt Pa)] sicut siciunt M1 S Ta. Of these three manuscripts M and Ta are closest to each other. They have, for example, the following common errors: Prol. M., 62 virtutum om. M1 Ta; Rev. 1, 19 in altari post immolatur M Ta; 1, 6o habebis post velis M Ta; 5, 61 ipsi om. M Ta; 5, 78 post erubescent add. confusione M1 Ta; 15 , 85 Ex his omnibus om. M1 Ta; 45, 44 ante colloquia add. nobis M Ta. There are also certain extrinsic criteria indicating their close relationship. Both contain, for instance, Extray. 241 and the acrostic poem Salue, o felix Brigida.2 However, neither of these manuscripts can have served as the original of the other since both contain errores separativi compared mutually and with other manu- scripts, for example, Rev. 4, 8 ilia] talia M verba Ta; io, 104 Cumque . . . passionis om. Ta; 31, 34 virginis om. M. Consequently, S cannot have been copied from either of these two manuscripts. Since S (written in 1418)3, is considerably younger Also found in q and Cb; see pp. 135, 202. found in F Cb and Db; see pp. 92, 117, 13o, 3 See above, p. 122. 1 2 Also 202, 203. 
 
 
 
 
 142 than M (written in 1394)4 it obviously cannot have served as the original of M. Neither can Ta have been copied from S, since this latter MS. contains several separate errors as compared to Ta and the other manuscripts, for example, Prol. M., 40 malorum om. S; Rev. 2, 19 cum eciam eo defuncto cogitasti (post assignasti) om. S.5 As mentioned above (p. 135), q in its present state lacks Rev. I 15: 26 Si enim- 37: 6 illorum, i.e. about a third of Book I. Thus our possibilities of fixing q's position more exactly within the 8 tradition are considerably limited. The manu- script does not contain information as to when it was transcribed. For the reasons given above it can be dated to around 1380-1414.6 From the above-cited examples of errores separativi in the manuscripts M S Ta, closely related to q, we can con- clude that none of these manuscripts can have been the original of q.7 Can the opposite be true? In other words, has q served as the direct original of M S Ta? Since the readings that ql shares with, for example, D Q h 1 s K8 do not appear in M S Ta, these manuscripts cannot have been copied from q in its uncorre ct e el form. Individual uncorrected errors seem to be rare in q.9 In the material in- vestigated by me I have observed only one individual error, viz, in Rev. 10, 144, where q alone has the reading cruce (written out in full) instead of cute. If M S Ta had been copied from q, it seems to me that at least one of these manuscripts would have taken over the reading from its original. It appears more probable that M S Ta derive from a source that was either a sister manuscript of q in which the individual errors typical of q(1) were missing, or else a copy of q in which these q(1) mistakes had been corrected.9 In conclusion I would like to point out that several corrections and supplements (M2 readings) occur in M. These seem to have been done in accordance with some y manuscript; for example, Prol. M., 204 post eundem add. petrum Ma (in m.) j La 111 Ea t; Rev. 8, 5 post ipse add. dilexit M2 (in m.) y; 14, 9 aliquid postfieri add. M2 (in m.) yla ante optas (v. 8) add. Da Ja; 16, 25 diabolum] omnes dyabolos Ma y;"" 59, 104 post mortem add. pati M2 y (and Ja; deest Da). These textual corrections in M may well have been carried out at the same time as a possible transcription of supplementary material (Decl. and Add.) was made from M to some y manu- script.10 Da ja Pa Another sub-group within the 3 manuscripts is made up of Da ja Pa, which See above, p. 116. On the relations of S to Fb see below, pp. 213-216. 4 See above, p. 135; q's relation to Fb indicates that its date may be about the same, i.e. 1386; see below, pp. 213-216; cf.

 1 43 have in common the following omissions amongst others: Prol. M., 72 gloriabatur; Rev. 5, 40 ipsa; 5, 42 et; 32, 57 diabolus. Two of these manuscripts are dated; Pa was finished in 1 453,11 ja in 1484.12 The following individual errors, amongst others, are found in Pa: Rev. 5, 75 Amici autem mei saluabuntur om. Pa; 32, 65 sq. vel artem talem eiciendi demones om. Pa. Because of these errors Pa cannot have been the original of Da ja or any of the other manuscripts examined. The manuscripts most closely related of the three are Da and ja which have many erroneous readings in common, for instance, Prol. M., 200 ad] per Da ja; Rev. I, 40 ut om. Da ja; 2, 51 in omnibus membris deliquisti, sic et] peccasti Da ja in omnibus Pa om. R; 9, 31 post spiritu add. ducti Da ja; 31, 41 omnis om. Da ja; 32,31 precedebat] antecedabat Da ja. Since both Da and ja contain several individual errors, neither can have been the original of the other or any of the other manuscripts. Examples of such errors are found in, for instance, Rev. 31, 39 sq. et demones non audent respicere in clari- tatem eius om. Da; Prol. M., 17 humilem om. Ja; 137 nisi quam Christus predicauit (post predicant) om. ja. Simply on the grounds of age ja cannot have been the original of Pa. Ga It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the exact position of Ga within the a tradition on the basis of its Prol. M. text. Rev. I is missing from this manu- script, as mentioned above, p. 86, n. 6, and p. 126. Ga shares certain erroneous readings with the D Q h 1 s K group, for example: Prol. M., 158 post ego add. ipse GaDQhlsK(andGh); 180 eosdem amicos meos (meos om. j1 La)] eos GaDQh1 s K (and q1). On the other hand it should be pointed out that Ga and two other a manuscripts, F and N, f3 and yi have kept the reading auditores in Prol. M., 128, which seems to me to be correct (see above, p. 88), and together with F N Ba p and I,' the correct reading regno in Prol. M., 181 (see above, pp. 91 f.). Further it can be established that on the basis of certain individual errors Ga cannot readily be assumed to be the original of any of the other manuscripts examined. For example, erat in Prol. M., 3 and mentis in Prol. M., 59 are omitted in Ga. F N Ba b As is generally known, the relationship between manuscripts is usually deter- mined on the basis of their common errors. I have shown above (p. 140) that N shares certain errors with the D Q h 1 s K group and with Ha q. When I now put N with F Ba b into a special sub-group of the a manuscripts it is not because these four manuscripts have common erroneous readings but because in several places they alone of the a manuscripts seem to have retained the original correct read- ing.12a That this is the case in these particular manuscripts cannot be attributed to pure chance. I have already treated a couple of these passages in the text; viz. Rev. See above, p. 129. See above, p. 128. 12a Cf. above, p. 83. 11 12 
 
 
 
 
 1 44 5: 1713 and 21, 50.14 I would like to add the following: Rev. 21, 31 per potenciam deitatis p F N Ba b (and Gh) de potencia deitatis 8 (exc. F N Ba b deest Da Ga Ha Ua q)15 idest potencia deitatis yi (deest j) T1 in potencia deitatis T2 Ea f t. The de handed down in most 8 manuscripts can have arisen in several different ways. It can be explained as an anticipation, i.e. as an error arising from the influence of deitatis which follows on potencia(m).16 It is also conceivable that the instrumental per was deliberately replaced by an instrumental de, "die Lieblingspraposition der spateren Latinitat",17 in the source from which the 8 manuscripts in question derive; i.e. in the hyparchetype 7t common to 3 and y. However, since there was no absolute reason for replacing a common per construction by a common de construc- tion in this section of the text, the following explanation of the divergent readings seems more likely. I assume that in the original t text there was per potenciam deitatis, as in f3. Later someone added in the margin de potencia deitatis. When a was copied from 7 the above note had most probably not yet been added to n or possibly it was there, but was correctly interpreted by the transcriber, who there- fore did not enter it into the a text. Thus the correct reading per potenciam deitatis was accurately handed down in the source from which FNBab seem to derive. The error in the a hyparchetype may well have arisen at a later date when some revisor compared the text of 3 with the text of 7 and mistook the marginal note de potencia deitatis for a correction of per potenciam deitatis and therefore entered it into the text itself.18 How is then the idest potencia deitatis in yl and T1 to be ex- plained ? My guess is that, when y was copied from t, the copyist understood the above-mentioned marginal note to be a correction of per potenciam deitatis but misinterpreted d' (= de)19 as ii• (= idest)20 and thus idest potencia deitatis came to be entered into the text. By a slight change of •i• ( = idest)19 to in)21 T2 has undoubt- edly succeeded in improving the distorted text of T1 and yl. Further, in Rev. 41, 81 we find ipsi handed down in p y (deest fj) F N Ba b M2 (and Gh), while it is missing in the other 8 manuscripts. There are reasons for believing that ipsi which is superfluous in this context—it refers to malos in the previous line—has been deliberately crossed out in the a hyparchetype at some point after the source See above, pp. 88 f. See above, p. 92; cf. Prol. M., 128 auditores, p. 88, and Prol. M., 181 regno Swecie, pp. 91 f. 15 Cf. 26, 54, below, p. 167. 16 On this type of errors see e.g. Willis 92-97. 17 Lofst., Peregr., 103. The pure ablativus instrumenti (e.g. Rev. 3: i) is often replaced in the Revelations by prepositional phrases, e.g. with de+abl. (Rev. 5: 12; 21: II; etc.), in+ abl. (e.g. Rev. 18: 5; 41: 2), per +ace. (e.g. Rev. 13, io; Prol. M.: 2); cf. H-Sz 125-127 (with further ref.). 18 Cf. Rev. 21, 5o where, in my opinion, the original marginal note scilicet peccatoris has been understood to be a supplement and has been entered into the text itself in all the a manuscripts except F N Ba b M2; see above, p. 92. We can find many examples in Ea, copied from T, of how marginal notes have been misunderstood and have found their way into the text itself; see above, pp. 61-63, cf. West 12 ff., 22 ff., 28; Willis 133 ff. 19 See Cappelli 86 f. 20 See Cappelli 168. 21 On the instrumental in see H-Sz 126 f.; Gloss., p. 458, S.V. in 2 c. 13 14 
 
 
 
 
 1 45 common to FNBab had been copied from a. Together with (3 y (deest v), F N Ba b (and Gh) provide the following text in Rev. 5 7: Tercius mons erat fortitudo Sampsonis, quam habuit super 22 omnes homines, i.e. "The third mountain was Simson's strength, which he had to a greater degree than all other men." The words quam habuit are missing in the rest of the 8 manuscripts. The clausal Secundus parallelism carried out in Rev. 51: 5-6, 8-9 (Primus mons erat Moyses mons erat Hellas Quartus mons erat Dauid ... Quintus mons erat Salomon ...) is broken in 51: 7, where one would have expected the text to have the following structure: Tercius mons erat Sampson, qui forcior fuit omnibus hominibus ... Cf. Rev. IV 84 Samson, qui, licet esset for tis simus , tamen a muliere victus est. If quam habuit was deliberately removed from a it was probably because fortitudo Sampsonis was taken to mean potestas S. and super omnes homines = omnium hominum (gen. obiectivus); cf. Rev. 51: 5; Gloss., super, 6. There occur several textual divergencies which indicate that the text of the 3 hyparchetype was successively revised. It appears that one reason for this might have been a wish to remove any unnecessary words; for example, 40, 6 intus in consciencia f3 y (deest f j) F Ba b (and Gh) in consciencia (cf. 58, 5 I) 8 (exc. F Ba b deest Da Ga Ha Ua); 48, 109 cogitantes secum sic 13 y (deest v) F Ba b cogitantes (dicentes K) sic a (exc. F Ba b deest Da Ga Ha Ua); cf. 47, 109, iI2; 58, 53 quod (ante dilexerunt) f3 y F Ba b om. 3 (exc. F Ba b deest Da Ga Ha U5). The removal of intus respectively secum in 3 can, however, be explained palaeographically as being due to haplography (it9 i 9sciencia respectively secu) sic). Finally I wish to call attention to a somewhat doubtful passage where F Ba alone among the 8 manuscripts offer a text which in principle should be taken as identical with that of the archetype. In Rev. 3: 3 Birgitta receives the following exhortation from God: Custodi humilitatem veram! Using a rhetorical question God tells her what "true humility" is: Que est humilitas vera nisi laudem Deo pro bonis datis tribuere? This is the reading of f3 (exc. J e deest I Fa) yi (deest Z) and F Ba. In 8 (exc. F Ba) Y2 (deest f) and the two p, manuscripts J e the text handed down is somewhat longer. For after nisi there follows in these manuscripts talem se ostender e qualis est et (qualis est om. J) laudem Deo pro bonis datis tribuere? As the p and y hyparchetypes obviously lacked talem ... et (these words have presumably found their way to Y2 and the source common to J e from some 8 manuscript23) these words were probably also missing from the archetype from which f3 and 7r derive.24 The definition of vera humilitas given in 3: 3 according to p yi F Ba, namely laudem Deo pro bonis datis tribuere, is supported by several other statements on humilitas and humilis in the Revelations, as is apparent from the parallels I have referred to in the app. sim., p. 248. Thus there is hardly any basis for the belief that the shorter version of the text is non-Birgittine and false. 22 Here the prep. super is used in the same way as pre Rev. 51: 4 propter humilitatem tuam, quam pre aliis habuisti. See my Gloss., s.v. pre, 2 A. 23 On the influence of a in y2 see p. 58, footn. 53; on J e cf. below, pp. 196 f. 24 On this fundamental reasoning see Bergh 94 ff., Bergh V, p. 67; above, pp. 52 f.; below, p. 225. 12 — 774372 C.-G.

 146 I consider that talem se ostendere, qualis est et is an addition entered in the a hypar- chetype probably only after the presumptive source of F and Ba had been copied from this hyparchetype.25 It must, however, be admitted that talem se ostendere, qualis est, "to show oneself as one is", i.e. not to want to appear better, superior, more pious etc. than others or than one really is, can also be supported by parallels from the Revelations; for example, Rev. I 34: 4 (Christ to Birgitta): Vestes tue debent esse humilitas interior et exterior, ut nec extollas te quasi aliis sancciorem interius nec erubescas coram hominibus exterius exhibere te humilem. IV 97 B Que simplicioribus te conformare. autenz est vera humilitas? Certe Of the four 8 manuscripts dealt with above two are dated, W and b, written in 1490 and 1445 respectively.26 F would seem to have been written at the end of the i4th century and N during the first half of the 15th century. It is quite obvious that an older manuscript cannot have been copied from a younger one. As all four manuscripts contain separative errors it is equally obvious that none of them can have been the original of any of the other three or of any other extant manu- script. Such errors are, for instance, Prol. M., 175 admittere] annuere F, Rev. 4, 13 esse factum, sine Deo nichil (post nichil) om. F; 6, 27 sq. eorum ... Dominus (X verba post Dominus) om. Ba; 5, 15 existens] es b, 31, 29 glorie] cell b. The latter two readings show that b has been interpolated;27 this can be illustrated by several examples, such as 32, 35 where b instead of Tria ostendi tibi. Primo unius conscien- ciam has Tria enim ostenduntur tibi. Primo vnius hominis consciencia. Examples of separative errors in N have already been given above, pp. 119, 140. F — Gh As is apparent from the critical apparatus of this edition, F1 and Gh in various places show conjunctive errors, for example, 37, 5o penam] passionem F Gh (and b), 47, 87 post fuerit add. coniunx F1 Gh, 52, 5o desiderii] gaudii Fl Gh, 54, 55 sancti] dei F' Gh. Of special interest is Rev. 52: 8 Dic amico tuo,ut patri suo, cuius cor est secundum cor meum, quod hec verba conscripta exponat diligenter ...; the concrete sense of this passage has already been discussed above, pp. 48-5o. Instead of amico tuo, ut patri suo found handed down in f3 (exc. E H I V A5 a) yl (exc. La j deest v) and a (exc. Fl M N W Ba ja Mb b g deest Da Ga Ha ua),28 Gh (plus Mb) have amico meo, patri tuo. The other manuscripts give the follow- ing readings: amico tuo vt patri tuo E M ja amico tuo ac (et W g t) patri tuo Y 2 W Ba La b g j amico tuo ut sponso tuo Aa amico suo et patri suo I patri tuo ut patri suo V a amico meo ut patri suo H29 amico meo et patri tuo N. I see no reason to doubt that the text established by me agrees with that of the archetype; this should have been clear from my previous discussion of this pas- Concerning supplements and other interpolations in a see above, pp. 85-92. See above, pp. 124 f., 131. 27 Cf. Bergh 67 f. 28 This reading is also found in Ab Bb and Fb; see below, pp. 200-202, 204-209. 29 Also in Cb; see below, pp. 202 f. 25 26 
 
 
 
 
 1 47 sage.30 It is difficult to give a reason why the text was changed in the Vadstena source from which F1 and Gh seem to derive. What is clear is that the person who changed the text considered that amico and patri referred to the same person, namely Magister Mathias, Birgitta's confessor at this time.31 In my opinion amico refers to Mathias and patri to Petrus Tyrgilsson, Bishop of the diocese of Lin- koping.32 In the Old Swedish translation of this text it is also a question of two different people: Sigh minom yin at han vt thydhe thesse saman scriwadho ordhin (BU, I, 179, 29-31; cf. Geete, Nio kapitel ur H. granlika for sinom fadhir Birgittas uppenbarelser, p. 29, 14 f.),33 i.e. "Say to my friend that he must meti- culously explain to his father these words written down ..."34 A contributing factor to the change in the text may have been that the pleonastic use of the final quod exponat ...) was considered to be gramma- ut conjunctions (Dic tically unsatisfactory35 or that cuius cor est secundum cor meum was not considered to be a suitable judgement on patri suo, if thereby someone other than Mathias was being referred to, for example, Petrus Tyrgilsson.36 In all the cases discussed here where Fl and Gh show conjunctive errors,37 F2 has corrected the text. This may have come about with the help of what is known as the Liber Alfonsi in Vadstena Cloister and which seems to have been used as a guiding rule.38 The examination of the a MSS. carried out here may entitle us to the following conclusion regarding their relationships. The MSS. seem to fall into two main branches. To the left-hand branch belong DQhisKNHaqMSTa Ga Da s r Pa W g, to the right-hand branch F Ba b (Gh and Mb). N, which is most closely connected with the D Q h 1 s K group (see above, pp. 139-141) of the left-hand branch, shares some correct readings with F Ba b (Gh and Mb). This may be due to the original of N having been influenced by some MS. belonging to the right- hand branch of the a manuscripts. Thus, N is contaminated. This is also the case with q, since it shows readings from more than one source. A possible stemma, which includes not only these but also the newly discovered MSS., will, for the sake of clarity, be presented below on p. 216, after the examination of those MSS. See above, pp. 48-50. Cf. Rev. 3: i 2. 32 See above, pp. 48-5o. 33 Concerning the Old Swedish translation of the Rev., see above, pp. 7 (with footnote 20) and 92, footn. 34 (with further references). 34 As is seen, the Old Swedish text agrees very closely with the Latin text handed down in H. 35 As is apparent from the critical apparatus, q2 has crossed out quod in Rev. 52, 31. Pleonasms of this kind are, however, like pleonasms in general, not at all unusual in the Revelations; e.g. see SA 3: 12 Edificauit habitaculum, vt quod, habitaret in eo; Bergh V, p. i66, 68 (in the app. crit.); cf. H-Sz 802, § 42 d, and Ind. rer., s.v. Pleonasms. 36 See Klockars, Biskop Hemming, 201. 37 In Rev. V there is also "a clear connexion between F and Gh"; see Bergh V, p. 53; cf. ib., pp. 72 f. 38 See above, pp. 27 ff. 36 31 
 
 
 
 
 148 The p MSS. The f manuscripts divide up into two main groups, p, and N2, each deriving from its own hyparchetype. The following 7 manuscripts belong to the p, group: PR VYAaSaa. Common to these are, for example, the following incorrect readings: 31, 25 ut instead of quod (consec.), 37, 23 redargueretur39 instead of argueretur, 41, 95 quod (rel.) instead of sicut (cf. 33, 17).40 The p, group consists of the following fifteen manuscripts: BCEHIJLOPOacdemo. In these we find, for instance, the following deviations from the correct text: I, 21 exclusus (deest I Fa) instead of expulsus, 5, 17 istam (deest I Fa) instead of hanc, 19, 32 enim instead of namque (autem D Q h om. 1 s; see above, p. 140), 3o, 25 sufficerent instead of sustinerent, 37, 7 humanitate compositum instead of humanitate, 47, 99 sponsa instead of sponsa vel sponsus. As mentioned above (p. 53), A, too, belongs to the p manuscripts. This manuscript shows none of the above-mentioned errors characteristic of p, and p2. However, as I shall show, it seems to be closer to p, than to p,. Thus I shall assign it to the former group and treat it with the pi manuscripts in the following description. The pi mss. A=Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. 169, cent. XV, ff. Ira_31-rb (VIII +120). I. Litt.: Madan—Craster II: 1 (1922), 176 (N° 2030). The first eight leaves of the manuscript are numbered with Roman, the remain- ing leaves with Arabic numerals; ff. I—V and 117-12o are of parchment, the rest of paper. All the parchment leaves, except for f. Vr, are without text. According to Madan—Craster II: I, 176, f. Vr contains "a mutilated part of a long latin official record of a case which came before the ecclesiastical court at Constance relating to the Augustinian monastery of st. Antony in the diocese of Vienne (1st half of isth. cent. ?)". The title Reuelaciones Brigitte is on the same page, presumably entered at the end of the 15th cent. In the upper margin of f.

The manuscript has clearly not been completed as the chapter initials have not been filled in by a rubricator. As is apparent from the note after the Explicit to Book IV, cod. A has belonged to a certain Johannes Rolynns. Who he was, Madan—Craster do not tell us. I, however, suspect that the owner is identical with one of the two John Rawlins mentioned by Emden III (1959), 1551. The elder of these was a fellow of Oriel College and "still living in 1450", the younger was a fellow of Magdalen College and "logic lecturer 1487-8 ... M.A. by 1490". If the note on the owner has been written by the same hand that wrote out the manuscript, then the owner and scribe of the manuscript can be one and the same man: Johannes Rolynns. The manuscript was presented to Bodleian Library by Sir Walter Cope in 1602.6 About this manuscript Madan—Craster say (II: 1, 176): "This is a Latin transla- tion by Richard Lavenham of the first four books ... of the Revelations of st. Brigitta." From where this erroneous information is derived, I do not know. It is repeated by Emden II (1958), 11 1o. The Richard Lavenham mentioned, who lived during the second half of the 14th cent., was born at Lavenham, Suffolk. He was a Carmelite friar, studied and became a professor at Oxford. Later he became prior of the Carmelite house at Bristol and confessor to Richard II. He is known as a fervent opposer of Wyclif's teachings and wrote commentaries on the Bible and several of the works of the Fathers of the Church and seems even to have lectured and commented on Birgitta's Revelations.6 This may have Here only the beginning of the rubrics plus etcetera are written. Occasionally these text rubrics are considerably revised, as for example Rev. I so: R which in A reads: Verba virginis Marie declara- toria passionis christi etcetera (cf. this ed. p. 263). 4 Madan-Craster are of the opinion that this note and the preceding text were written by one and the same hand and interpret the word after Johanni as "Rolyn' (?: apparently altered to Rolynh or Rolynntes)". Concerning constare (alicui) = esse (alicui or alicuius), 'to belong (to somebody)', see Lm 109, s.v. "1 constamen". According to Lm constare in this sense occurs in British and Irish sources for the first time in 1388. 6 See DNB, XII (1887), 168. 6 See DNB, XXXII (1892), 211 f., where, among other works, one with the title In Revela- tiones S. Birgittae Lib. VII is ascribed to Lavenham. If this information is correct, then this work

P is a parchment manuscript in large folio size (37,5 X 26 cm) consisting of 209 leaves. The recto pages have been numbered in pencil in modern times.' The text is entered in two columns per page by the same scribe throughout. The beautiful miniatures found in the manuscript have been examined and de- scribed in detail by Angela Daneu Lattanzi and Carl Nordenfalk (see above). Both scholars consider that these miniatures, which are astoundingly like those in Y (see p. 157), indicate a Neapolitan artist. "The scenes painted in the initials are so close not only in composition but also in execution that the two manuscripts" (i.e. P and Y) "clearly have a common origin. They must indeed be the work of one artist" states Nordenfalk 378.2 Both these scholars are also agreed that P and Y must have been executed before Birgitta's canonization in I 3 9 1, an opinion I share.3 This MS. has earlier belonged to the Benedictine monastery of San Martino delle Scale outside Palermo.4 In all probability, as Lattanzi shows, it is identical with a MS. found listed in the still preserved medieval catalogue of manuscripts belonging to the library of the above-mentioned monastery between 1384 and should be a commentary on the revelations in Book VII; cf.

Fa (p. 187) in which it is stated that Richardus Lavinghamus Author (!) est. 1 To these have been added 6 unnumbered leaves, 3 at the beginning and 3 at the end. They have presumably been added at the binding carried out in the i800's. In binding, the original, slightly larger, size was cut down somewhat. Certain column titles in the upper margin were cut away, like the majority of the numbers in the older, probably original, folio numbering in the upper right-hand corner of the recto pages. The original order can still be discerned here and there in the MS.; e.g. if. 13,18,33, 34, 44, 58, zo6, 209. An older numbering is still found on, for exam- ple, f. I4or where 1 gz(=.52) is written. I had the pleasure of studying this MS. in the original during a visit to Palermo in 1962. 2 Cf. Lattanzi 8 f.; Lattanzi, I manoscritti, 64. 3 Both Lattanzi and Nordenfalk base this dating on the appearance of the miniatures. Norden- falk draws special attention to the fact that Birgitta is portrayed without a halo. Lattanzi also refers to the appearance of the handwriting in P as support for her dating; however, she does not present her palaeographic arguments. See Nordenfalk 379 f. (cf. Y p. 157); Lattanzi 7, o; Lattanzi, I manoscritti, 64; cf. Bergh 6o, n. 27. Collijn and Schtick (Mc. cit.) both state that P was written at the beginning of the I400'S. 4 This is clear from stamps and notes in the MS., e.g. f. 1r in the lower margin, where in a 17th- century hand is written: Reuelationes Beate Brigitte de suecia una cum eius uita in calce. Est Monasterij Sancti Martini de scalis Panormi. Under this note there is the stamp of BIBLIOTECA DI S. MARTINO. On this monastery, see Renzo Lo Cascio, 'La Biblioteca di S. Martino delle Scale' in Bolletino. Centro di studi filologici e linguistici Siciliani, 1, Palermo, 1953, pp. 263-289. 
 
 
 
 
 151 1418. P does not seem to have been entered in the catalogue until 1386,5 at the earliest. The texts of Rev. I and Prol. M. handed down in P and Y show such charac- teristic peculiarities that, as I shall show, there seem to be grounds for thinking that the two manuscripts originate from the same source. However P seems to have been separated from this common source by at least one intermediary. The fact that P at the end contains two texts, RS and a Birgitta Vita, that are missing from Y, may indicate that P was copied from an original which—besides the contents common to Y and P—also contained these two texts. The scribe of P can naturally also have had more than one original at his disposa1.6 Contents . I ra_2ra: Li st of the rubrics in Rev.

In my opinion cum tabulis in the catalogue must refer to the lists of rubrics (tabulae capitulorum) that are entered before Rev. I—VIII in P. Also in the Explicit to the list of rubrics to Rev. VI (f. 12°) the list in question is designated tabula capitulorum (cf. Oa p. 189, n. 5). When Salvatore Maria Di Blasi, librarian of San Martino monastery out- side Palermo, thought that he could identify P as the alius liber ... cum tabulis mentioned in the catalogue, he observed, according to Lattanzi 3, that "l'esemplare in pergamena, ..., non era pia coperto di tavol e, come in antico, ma rilegato in pergamena." As far as I can make out, Di Blasi must have misunderstood the cum tabulis given in the catalogue. Unfortunately I have not had access to his account, `Relazione della nuova libreria del Monastero di S. Martino delle Scale ...' in Opus- coli di autori siciliani, XII (1771), pp. 186-190; cf.

This parchment manuscript, which most probably originates from the second half of the Ives, consists of 257 leaves. Of these, the first 18 are numbered with Roman, the remainder with Arabic numerals. As is evident from the following description of contents, a number of prophecies attributed to the Erythraean sibyl have been entered between Prol. M. and Rev. I, an arrangement I have not come across in any other manuscript. The combination of these prophecies and Birgitta's Revelations is, however, not so very extraordinary, since many of the Revelations are of a prophetic nature.12 The contents of the manuscript, entered in one column per page by the same hand throughout, are as follows: See above, pp. 16-2o. The latter part of the rubric to ch. 8 is erased. 10 This version of RS, the so-called Regula in prima persona, agrees with that in K; see p. x xo with footnotes 72-74; above, pp. 2 f., n. 12. 11 The content of this Birgitta Vita agrees in the main with the Vita published by Collijn, A&P, 71-105, on the basis of L and two other manuscripts. Exactly the same redaction seems to be found in the so-called codex Nordenskiold in Helsinki University Library; see Collijn, A&P, PP.

Further it may be mentioned that the number of list rubrics of Book IV is 144, whereas there are 165 text rubrics.

Judging by information given in the manuscript itself, the majority of V (see be- low) has been entered by two scribes, Johannes Noen.1 de Almania and Lodouicus. The former, whose name is found in the Explicit after Rev. IV (p. 272: Explicit liber reuelationum dej Quartus beate Brigide diuinitus reuellatus. Per Jo. noen.1 de Almania exarratus. Sintque semper deo pro eo exoratus2 Amen.) has written out the first half of the manuscript. The second half (from SA, p. 273a), completed 16th May, 1415, has been written out by the above-mentioned Lodouicus, as is apparent from the Explicit after Rev. VIII (p. 543b).3 A leaf missing from the be- ginning of the manuscript contained the first half of Prol. M. (to § 19 in celo regnans incl.). A third scribe, however, has later entered the missing text (Jncipit See Hollman 52. 14 Cf.

The pp. same remarkable arrangement is found in a, which further has the who of the text of 20 entered between ch. 5 and 6 in Rev. I; see p. 165. In V the incorrectly placed rubric is now crossed out and is completely missing from the list of rubrics. pp. 721)-74a: Orationes. Yncipiunt orationes beate Brigide vidue principisse neritie de regno suetie ut edocta fuit a christo diuersis Diuersimodis horis horarre (!).

The majority of these prayers are included in certain chapters in the Revelations.' pp. 75a---76b: List of the rubrics in Rev. II. Of the rubric to ch. 20 only a part is entered (p. 76a): Verba querimonie transeunt etcetera. Capitulum xx (cf. above). pp. 76b-118a: Rev. II (with text rubrics).

I 8: 2-3, III i D, IV 74 Q—R, 89 A—B, 94 B, 126 M, VI 34, RS 5. A prayer entered on p. 73 under the rubric Cum comunicare uolueris is of some interest as it seems to be a longer version of one sent in Nov. 1371 by request to the Spaniard Gomez Albornoz, the Papal Governor of the Duchy of Spoleto in Italy; the prayer is included in a letter to the above- mentioned Gomez. It is found printed in full in DS, X, pp. 102 f. (with ref.). It has been published earlier in Westman 299-301. After this prayer there follows another containing the following: 0 Domine yesu christe qui in cena sanctisima corpus tuum et sanguinem tradidisti disci- Obsecro to da michi peccatori famulo tuo johanni semper reminisci quia mortuus es pullis (!) tuis secundum magnam misericordiam tuam. Amen. Who the Johannes mentioned pro peccatis meis was, is uncertain. He may be identical with the Johannes Noen. de Almania who is given as having written out the first half of V (see above, p 153). In a there is in the same prayer (f. 58') ... mi- chi ... famulo tuo johanni Jacob°. It is possible thatjacobo is intended to be a "correction" of johanni, the reading of the original, i.e. V. If this is the casegacobus may be identical with the scribe respon- sible for a (see below, pp. 165, 166 f.). On the prayers which correctly or incorrectly have been attributed to Birgitta see Westman 125-129, 59 if.; BU, 4, 159-176, 197-211; 5, 234-238.

Cod. V belonged to the Camaldulian monastery of S. Michele di Murano in Venice before it was transferred to Biblioteca Marciana in the same town at the beginning of the 19th century.11 Bergh, who has studied the text of Rev. VII in this and other manuscripts, has shown (pp. 37 f., 5o) that there is a close relationship between V and the Vatican manuscript r. In his opinion—and this is probably correct—r (written in 1399; see Bergh 36 f.) in a corrected form (r2) has been the original of V.12 The relationship between the two manuscripts can, however, be confirmed further. In r the same hand that has written Book VII has entered after this the following note on f. 142v: Anno • M• c'ec• septuagesimo tercio. Obtjt rome Brigida beata. Que • M• cCc. quadragesimo sexto Cepit hec presencia archana videre. Santorum ascripta cathalogo nonagesimo primo. Apart from a few spelling mistakes—there are plenty of them in V13 theidentical note has been inserted in V, indeed entered twice, Concerning the rubrics and the text of chs. 18, 19 and 3o in Book VII see Bergh 35, 37 f. ES 8 (including the rubric), which forms a prologue of a kind to Book VIII (see pp. 22 ff.), has been placed before the list of rubrics of this book. Strangely enough V, like r, lacks the rubric as well as the text of Rev. VIII 53. 7 8 See Bergh 36 f.; Hollman 95-97, 165 f. 9 See above, pp. 2 f., n. 12; cf. Aa p. 163, footnote 5. 10 See Aa pp. 163 f. with footnote 7. n See Undhagen 48 with footnotes I and 2. 12 Examples taken at random from other books in r and V have given the same result. However, I would like to point out that Bergh's statement p. 37 that the corrections which a later hand has made in r are also to be found in V, but there written out by the first hand, is not correct. In the first place the corrections in r have not all been made by the same hand. Some corrections are, judging by the handwriting, of a much later date than those made by the same hand that has written out Book VII. In the second place not all the corrections in r (=r2 readings) have been inserted in V. That this has not taken place can, as far as I can see, be explained in three ways: I) The scribe of V has not observed all the corrections in r. 2) The scribe of V has observed all the corrections but has repudiated some of them and therefore not entered them in his manuscript. 3) Certain corrections in r have been made after V had been copied from it. I would like to draw attention to the following passages of the text where the r2 readings have not been entered in V: Rev. VII 5, 33 vigilanter] uel uigilanter in m. r2 (according to Bergh's critical app.: "vigilanter in marg. r2") violanter r1. In V there is neither uel uigilanter, vigilanter nor violanter but ulollenter which I consider to be a conscious emendation of violanter in r; the r2 reading had probably not been entered when the transcriber of V made his transcript. The handwriting does not agree with that of r1; 5, 84 deum om. r1- V ipsum deum in m. r2 (in the same handwriting as the preceding correc- tion); 13, 228 occultas ta V in auscultas mut. r2 occultas uel auscultas in m. sup. r2 (vel r3). Bergh's account in the critical app. of the different readings in r is in this case not entirely correct. 15 See Undhagen 51. 
 
 
 
 
 156 once after the Explicit of Rev. IV on p. 272 and once after the Explicit of Rev. VII on p. 453.14 That V really has been copied from r seems even more probable since one of the scribes, Johannes de Almania (see above, p. 153), appears to have been given r in 1399. For a note in r, entered on f. 118r after the Explicit of Rev. VD5 by another hand than that which has entered the preceding and succeeding text, gives the following information: Ego frater ypolitus abbas indignus concedo istum librum Sancte Brigide fratrj Johannj de alamania toto tempore vite sue. Cuius proprietas remaneat monasterio in quo dicti fratris Johannis celebrabitur obitus. Anno dominj Mccclxxxxviiij.16 If we combine the facts given in this note with what we already know about r (see Bergh 36 f.) and V, it would seem that the following conclusions can be drawn. Abbot Ypolitus of the monastery of S. Gerolamo di Quarto outside Genoa, which Birgitta's confessor Alfonso had helped to found in 1382 but which before his death in 1389 he had given to the Olivetans of Siena (see below, p. 157), gave in 1399 cod. r to a fellow monk, Johannes de Alamania. Using r as the original Johannes de Alamania and the above-mentioned Lodouicus then transcribed V. This presupposes, however, that by istum librum Sancte Brigide Ypolitus meant not only Rev. VI after the Explicit of which the note is entered, but the whole of r the contents of which coincide with the latter half of V (from SA to Extray. 49 incl.) and furthermore a now lost first part of r containing Prol. M., Rev. I—IV and—possibly—the selection of prayers found in V.17 It is not unlikely that originally r also comprised a third part containing Constituciones and Officium S. Birgitte, the texts of which are also included in V, but naturally these can also have been copied from another original. The circumstance that also Rev. I and Prol. M. in V can be taken as copied from a now lost first part of r, which was copied from the so-called Alfonso original, makes it necessary to devote due attention in this study to the readings of V. Whether V was originally written to be used in the above-mentioned Camal- dulian monastery in Venice, whether Johannes de Alamania ended his days in the monastery (cf. above, the note on f. I I8r in r), and whether the preserv- ed part of r or another part of this manuscript ever belonged to this monastery, founded in the 13th century,18 are questions I must leave for others to answer. Y = New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, MS. M. 498, cent. XIV late, ff. I ra-54''b (414). Lit.: D'Ancona; Bergh 36, 38-40, 50 f., 6o, footnote 27; 89 ff.; Bond—Faye, Bergh has (p. 87, footnote 15) observed this note in r but obviously not its counterpart in V. The text of the Explicit is found printed in Bergh 36. Instead of the year 1399 which has been written twice (M°ccc°i°c•M°c°c°c°ic°), would seem to have been 1390 (M°cce°x°c•M°c°c°c°xc°; x changed to i as far as I can make out). 18 Earlier observed and published by J.-O. Tjader in a review of Bergh's thesis in NTBB, 55 (1968), 25 f. Tjader also supposes that the Johannes de Al(a)mania mentioned in the two manu- scripts refers to the same person. 17 These, however, can very well have been compiled by Johannes de Almania. 1$ See Heimbucher I, 3i7. 14 15 
 
 
 
 
 157 Supp/., p. 347; Greene—Harrsen 45 (No 95); Harrsen—Boyce 25 f. (N° 46); Norden- falk 373 f., 378 ff.; De Ricci—Wilson II, 1462; Westman, Tvdhandskrifter, pp. 21-23. Y holds a unique position amongst all extant manuscripts of St. Birgitta's revelations because of its extraordinarily beautiful artistic ornamentation: 2 whole- page pictures (ff. 4V and 3431 and 12 historiated initials; these have been thoroughly studied and described by several writers on the history of art, first by Paolo D'Ancona (1912) and most recently by Professor Carl Nordenfalk (1961; see above). According to Nordenfalk and most other scholars, the miniatures indicate that the manuscript originates from Naples. Since in this manuscript and in several others closely related to Y (amongst others P; see p. i5o) St. Birgitta "is represented without the ordinary form of halo given in the same manuscripts to the saints in heaven" Nordenfalk considers (p. 379) "that the miniatures were painted before 13 91, the year of her official canonization" and that "on stylistic grounds ... the Morgan manuscript could even be some five or ten years earlier". This dating has been later accepted by Bond—Faye, Supp/., p. 347, where the manuscript is given as being "Written and illuminated at Naples before Birgitta's canonization, ca. 1380-1390". D'Ancona 1 f. dates it to the first half of the I400's and Westman, Tvd handskrifter, p. 21, dates it to the mid-I400's. I myself have found no reason to doubt Nordenfalk's dating and I therefore accept it as most probably correct. The manuscript, which Pierpont Morgan Library acquired from La Libreria Olschkil in Florence, originally belonged to the monastery of St. Girolamo di Quarto sulla Riviera,2 outside Genoa; this is apparent from the following colophon on f. 414": Jste liber Reuelationum Beate Brigide est conuentus fratrum sanctj Jeronimj de quarto riperie2 ordinis montis oliuetj.3 This monastery was founded in 1382 by Lirgitta's Spanish confessor Alfonso and a number of other exiled Spanish hermits of the Order of St. Jerome, recognized as a branch of the Augus- tinian order by Pope Gregory XI in Avignon 1374. Alfonso, who spent the last years of his life in this monastery, gave it shortly before his death (1389) to the Olivetans of Siena, a branch of the Benedictine Order.4 Westman (Tvd handskrifter, 22 f.) has given it as his firm opinion that Y is identical with a manuscript, the property of an anonymous private person, which was offered in 1858 for sale to Sweden by the consul in Cagliari, Sardinia, at that time, Mr. Antoine Thorel.

 158 scholar. The question of identity is, in my opinion, far too important to pass over in silence. I shall therefore account for my opinion on this matter, but I should like first to describe the appearance and contents of Y. Cod. Y is a parchment manuscript bound in dark green, elegant binding deco- rated with gold, from Lortic5 in Paris ca. 1890. It is 26,9 x 18,6 cm.6 The leaves number 414.7 Besides the consecutive numbering entered in modern times there is an older, presumably original, numbering consisting of 3 series of numbers, ff. 1-119, ff. 1-182, ff. I-107.8 The text is entered in two columns per page apparently by a single scribe with very clear and easily read handwriting. The text is arranged in an unusually lucid and perspicuous manner: each book generally begins on a new page and in the upper margin column titles give the contents of the respective pages (Prologus, Liber Celestis Reuelationum dei. Liber Celestis Reuelationum dei • II. us, etc., Liber Celestis Reuelationum dei vltimus, Liber Celestis Imperatoris ad Reges, Sermo Angelicus De excellentia virginis),9 and in nearly every chapter there are subdivisions into numbered paragraphs (CI, €.2, (,3 etc.), an arrangement which I, like Westman, have not met with in any other manuscript containing the Revelations.10 Contents ff.

The manuscript ends with the colophon mentioned above, p. 157. I now return to the question whether, as Westman believed, Y is really iden- tical with the above-mentioned manuscript (p. 157) which was offered for sale in 1858 to Sweden. In a letter dated Febr. 1858 and written in French, to Sven Loven, Professor of Zoology, curator of Riksmuseet in Stockholm and one of the most prominent Swedish zoologists in the i800's, a member of Kungl. Svenska Vetenskaps- akademien (The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) etc., Antoine Thorel, Swedish consul in Cagliari 1844-1863,19 writes that one of his acquaintances owns a precious parchment manuscript from the 14th century containing St. Birgitta's Revelations. The anonymous owner wishes to sell his manuscript. He claims to have been offered 5 000 francs for it by the Prince of Bavaria's antiquary,20 but says that he wants at least I o 000 francs. Thorel assures Prof. Loven that although he himself has no interest in the manuscript he considers that it can be of value to scholarship and so he wishes to acquaint Professor Loven21 and the Academy of Sciences with its existence and the possibility of buying it. Thorel encloses a detailed description in Italian of the manuscript. From this description, which Thorel has obtained from the owner of the manuscript, it is apparent that the 17 The folio numbers of the older numbering also here are incorrect: instead of f. 82 there should have been 90, and f. 99 should have been f. 107. 1, The older numbering is incorrect: f. 102 should have been f. i o8 and f. 107 should have been f. I 3. 19 See J. A. Almquist, Kommerskollegium och Riksens standers manufakturkontor samt konsuls- staten 1651-1910 (Meddelanden fran Svenska Riksarkivet. Ny fOljd, 2: 4, Haft. 2, Stockholm, 1 914), 13- 393- 20 Which two persons are meant by "l'antiquaire" and the "Prince de Baviere" I am unable to determine with any certainty. Presumably they are Ludvig II, King of Bavaria 1864-1866 (or his father Maximilian II Josef) and the well-known classical philologist Professor Karl Halm, from 1856 head librarian and director of the Hof- and Staatsbibliothek in Munich; see G. Leyh, Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, III: 2 (1957), pp. 170, 176, 187 ff., 37o ff. 21 Why Thorel should address himself to Loven, a professor of Zoology, in this matter I do not know. It may have been because Loven appears to have had a personal interest in St. Birgitta. Dr. Christian Callmer, First Librarian of Lund University Library, has had the kindness to apprise me of the fact that Loven had in his possession a manuscript from ca. 1500 containing a French transla- tion of, amongst other works, 15 prayers which, most probably incorrectly, have been attributed to St. Birgitta. (see BU, 4, 197 ff-; 5, 234 ff.; cf. above, p. 154, footnote 5). Professor Loven presented the manuscript in 1865 to the Royal Library in Stockholm, where it now has mark A 87. 
 
 
 
 
 61 manuscript consisted of 407 leaves, 27,5 X 19,5 cm, that it was 8 cm thick and weighed 3 30o g, that it contained 2 large well preserved miniatures, one with 78, the other with 55 persons depicted and 15 smaller miniatures with a total of 57 persons depicted and further that it contained many, very beautiful, arabesques. The manuscript is given as being written in Latin in Gothic script and to be completely undamaged. Its binding is said to date from the i600's. The owner claims that in the manuscript there is a note stating that seven such manuscripts were transcribed and that the one described in the letter is the first; i.e. the origi- nal.22 An account of the principal contents of the two letters23 was given by Westman (272, footnote 2) in 1911.24 After having seen Y in New York, Westman declared in 1913 that the manuscript described in Thorel's letter coincided on so many points with the Morgan manuscript that there could be no doubt of its identity.25 Although I myself have not seen the original of Y, but only a microfilm, I con- sider that there are certain circumstances which speak against Westman's opinion on the identity of the two manuscripts. Amongst other things the number and the size of the leaves do not agree.26 Further Y lacks the above-mentioned note which, according to the Italian description, should be found in the manuscript in ques- tion. Even if Y is probably not identical with the manuscript mentioned by Thore127 22 "E notato nel libro che di questi manoscritti se ne fecero sette e che questo a el primo, cio- e l'originale." There seems no reason for doubting that libro here is ---- manoscritto; i.e. the manu- script described in the letter. For the manuscript is referred to as libro 3 more times in the letter: "II libro e scritto in lingua latina II Libro pesa Spessore del Libro ..." Westman 272, foot- note 2, has misunderstood this passage in the Italian description as he claims that seven (instead of six) transcriptions of the manuscript were made. " The letters are kept in the Royal Library, Stockholm, and are included, according to informa- tion from Dr. Harry Jarv, First Librarian of the same library, in "U 22: 13. Klemming, G. E., Birgittalitteratur. Kungl. Biblioteket". They have obviously been donated by Professor Loven to the well-known Birgitta scholar Gustav Edvard Klemming, who was head of the Royal Library 1865-1890. I should like here to express my thanks to Dr. Jary who has kindly put photostat copies of the letters at my disposal. 14 It is not apparent from Westman's description that there are two letters, nor that they are written in French and Italian, respectively.

The difference in the size of the leaves can possibly arise from the leaves having been cut somewhat in the binding of the manu- script at the end of the i800's, see above p. 158. 27 Obviously the Swedish side were unable to raise enough money to buy the manuscript. Klem- ming, who had tried to obtain more detailed information about it, has noted in the margin at the end of the above description of the manuscript: "Ingen upplysning om agaren kunde vinnas. InkOp for 10 000 frcs var omOjligt"; i.e.: No information about the owner could be obtained. Purchase for io 000 frcs was impossible (cf. Westman 272, footnote 2).—In this context it may be mentioned that d'An- cona 2, footnote i, has put forward the conjecture that Y could be identical with the manuscript of the Revelations described in Nouvelle biographie generale.

 X62 it may of course have been one of the six manuscripts said to have been copied from "1' originale".28 It seems reasonable to suppose that a magnificent manuscript like Y was prepared for someone in a high position. There is reason to believe that it was one of the transcripts made during the canonization process at the end of the 1370's.29 Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, MS. A D XIV 23, cent. XIV late (?), ff.

In the so- called Skokloster collection of manuscripts, which has been deposited in Svenska riksarkivet, Stock- holm, since 1892, there is no manuscript of the Revelations which either now is or then was worthy of being called "le plus bel exemplaire manuscrit". This could, however, refer to the extra- ordinarily beautiful copy of the editio princeps of St. Birgitta's Revelations found in Skokloster library. This copy was printed on parchment by Bartholomaeus Ghotan in Lubeck 1492. Of the 16 parchment copies printed that year there are only 5 preserved, 2 of which are in Swedish libraries. Besides the Skokloster copy there is one, since 1925, in the Royal Library, Stockholm. The former, which is bound in a white parchment binding from the I7oo's, is richly illuminated with hand painted woodcuts and initials. It can still be seen in Skokloster library; see I. Collijn, Sveriges bibliografi intill dr 1600, I, Uppsala, 1934-1938, pp. 117 - 128 (espec. 126 f.); id., NTBB, 5 (1918), PP. 146-148; Hollman 19 f.; Ottervik—Mohlenbrock, Bibliotek i Sverige, pp. 64 f.

I have not had the opportunity to study the original manuscript, but only a microfilm of it. Unfortunately the film is of very poor quality and thus the manuscript has been in parts unnecessarily difficult to read. 2 According to the notes of Dr. Ernst Nygren dated 7th of June 1939. The microfilm covers only 274 leaves which seems to be due to the photographer omitting to photograph 3 double pages. In any case this applies to ff. 29v + 3or in Rev. I (see below). 3 The microfilm lacks ff. 29v +3or containing the text of Rev. I 54: 27-56: 12 ( — cies mori voluptatem suam). 
 
 
 
 
 163 ff. 32vb_ 276": Rev. II—VII, ES, Rev. VIII, all preceded by a list of rubrics,4 IV Or. (common rubric: Quattor oraciones reuelate beate brigide), each one with a rubric, RS (the so-called Regula in prima persona comprising 3 + 31 chapters of which the last is 277ra),5 SA (preceded by a Prologus entered separately at the end of the manuscript on f. and the list of rubrics to its lecciones),6 IV Or. (Yncipiunt oraciones quatuor Beate brigide ...), each one with a rubric, Officium S. Birgitte, composed by Birgerus Gregorii, Archbishop of Uppsala (Jncipit officium beate brigide de regno suetie. Quod composuit Archiepiscopus <B>Rigide matris indite ... Magnificat anima mea dominum.).7 vbsalensis in suetia As is apparent, the IV Or. have been entered twice. After the office in honour of St. Birgitta there follows (f. 276v) as in V (p. 577) —a long note entered by the same hand as the preceding text. In this note, among other things, is mentioned Birgitta's canonization;8 thus we can conclude that Aa 4 Book VII ends with the following Explicit: Explicit septimus et ultimus liber reuellacionum s an c t e brigide de Alamania (!) de suecia etcetera. Of importance in dating Aa is the use of sancta concerning Birgitta (see below). The extraordinary information about Birgitta's origins, which also appears in the Incipit of Rev. V (... beatam Brigidam de regno Suecie uidelicet de alamania), in the Incipit to the list of the rubrics in Book VII (... beatam brigidam de Alamania natam uidelicet de suecia), in the Explicit to SA (... beate brigide de alamania) and in a long note at the end of the manuscript, f. 276' (... fuit filia regis suetie in partibus Alamanie ... in regno suecie in partibus Alamanie constituto), points to the author of the note being insufficiently informed about Birgitta's nationality. The error arises most probably from a confusion between Suecia (= Sweden) and Sueuia (= Schwaben). In medieval Latin texts Alemania (Alamania) is used partly as a synonym for Sueuia and partly to mean Germania (Germany), consequently denoting a part of Germany as well as the whole of it (see for example Graesse-Benedict and Sleumer). In Aa Suecia has obviously been interpreted to be part of Germany (Alamania). 5 The Cloister Rule is preceded in the manuscript by Urban VI's Bull of 3rd Dec. 1378 (Ad perpetuam rei memoriam), by which the so-called Regula in ter cia persona was confirmed by the Holy See. To the Bull are added two letters (the second incomplete) to Vadstena Cloister written by Cardinal Thomas de Frignano (see A&P, 679) and Elziarius de Sabrano (see A&P, 656), re- spectively; on these two redactions of RS see above, pp. 2 f., n. 12. 6 See above, pp. 3 (with footn. 13), 24. 7 Published in 1960 by Undhagen on the basis of other manuscripts (see Bibliography, p. xxix). The presence of the office in Aa was then unknown to the editor. Examples taken at random from the text of the office in Aa show that this MS. represents the same recension of the text as V (called v in that edition of the office). Both these manuscripts have, for example, in Or. I, p. 182,13 the reading archana, whereas the other manuscripts have secreta. Furthermore, the same extra prayer appears in Aa as is found in V after Or. I (see Undhagen 5o). In L. IX 38, p. 224,1-3 seventeen words have been left out in V, but these are found in Aa. Consequently Aa cannot have been copied from V. Whether Aa may have been the original of V a succeeding study must show; cf. p. 155. 8 <I> N isto libro continentur reuellaciones s an c t e (cf. n. 4; below, p. 219, n. 19) brigide ... que uxor comitis Andree(!) de regno supradicto ... Cum quo ipsa habuit duos filios et unam filiam(!) fuit anno Mccc lxxxxj ... claret multis canonizata per papam Bonifatium nonum ... Et fuit miraculis. Et ubique locorum ubicumque imploratur adoratur aut honoratur eius ymago sancta atque figura (cf. A&P, 166-173, 233; Nordenfalk 381). Deo gracias Amen. According to this note Birgitta was clearly supposed to have been the wife of a certain comes Andreas and to have had two sons and one daughter by him. None of this is correct. Her husband was Ulf Gudmarsson who was a "law- man" in Narke (legifer Nericie). She had eight children by him; four sons and four daughters; see, for example, AS, Oct., Tom. IV, 385 ff.; SBL, 4 (1924), 448 ff.; SRS, III: 2 (1876), 209 if. The three children the writer ascribes to Birgitta are probably her daughter Katarina and her sons Birger 
 
 
 
 
 164 was written after 7th 0 ct. I 3 91. The scribe also reveals his name, Manfredus, in the following two Leonine verses entered after the note: Nomen scriptoris si to cognoscere queris. Man tibi sit primal), fre median dusque postrema9. After these lines Manfredus has entered a further note: Liber domus cartusie iuxta papiam. The manuscript has thus belonged to the famous Carthusian monastery, La Certosa di Pavia, situated 8 km north of Pavia between Milan and Genoa.'° This monastery was founded in 1396, and in 1398 the first members moved in. In all probability the Manfredus named was a monk of the monastery. If he wrote Aa there, then the date of origin can be fixed more exactly: earliest 1 3 9 8.

Thus Sa has previously belonged to the Dominican monastery of Corpus Christi in Venice,2 where evidently a second volume of Revelations was also preserved.

The manuscript, which has earlier belonged to the well-known humanist, Domenico Dominici, Bishop of Torcello, later of Brescia (-1- 1478),1 is beautifully illuminated. Contents ff. ra -3': Prol. M. The Incipit is missing. Explicit prologus in libro celestium Reuelacionum dei. Deo gracias. ff. 3va-7vb: List of the rubrics in Rev. I. Besides the rubric texts, the beginning of the text of each respective chapter is entered. The numbering of the different chapters, Primum Capitulum etc., has strangely enough been separated from the rubric to which it belongs and has instead been written immediately above the rubric to the succeeding chapter. This discrepancy is consistent throughout the whole list. Jncipit Rubrica libri celestis Reuelacionem dei primi paulo antedicti Expliciunt Capitula siue Rubrica reuelacionum dei, as in V (see p. 154).

The rubrics to chapters 26-30 are missing, but clearly they have been entered on a leaf which is now missing from the manuscript. For, as catchword on f. 6o" in the lower margin is Capitulum xxvj. Only the beginning of the rubric to ch. 20 (see above ) is entered: Verba querimonie dei de tribus que nunc per mundum transeunt etcetera etc. ff. 6/ ra _95 va: Rev.

 166 With regard to the mutual relationships between the pi manuscripts it can be established that none of them, except for V which may have been the original of a, can have served as the original of or been copied from any of the other manu- scripts within the group, since in each of these manuscripts errores separativi occur, for example the following: 2, 23 habere cum anima casta om. P, 4, 39 que est illis ad humiliacionem eorum om. R, 26, 128 velle om. V, 23, 7o sq. emendandi commissa et voluntas (post voluntas) om. Y, 52, 16 sq. Et ego ... choros (XV verba) propter (XLV verba ante aliquod) om. Sa, om. Aa, 32, 62-67 propter aliquod 59, 96 sq. omnes semel in dorso meo, quando erat totum om. a; 32, 40 et quam infelix ille est, cui dominatur diabolus, ideo suffero eum adhuc om. A. On account of certain errores coniunctivi the p, manuscripts can be divided into two subgroups, one consisting of V a and the other of P R Y Aa Sa. V a—P R Y Aa Sa It should be clear from my description of a (p. 165) and V (pp. 153-156) that these two manuscripts are closely interrelated. To the outer criteria of their relationship already mentioned above may be added the following inner criteria: Prol. M., 92 personis om. V a, Rev. 8, 4 pro certo om. V a, 23, z8 quomodo placeat hominibus et quid utilitas carnis om. V a; io, 112 solidius] fortius (-cius a) V a, 37, 94 induracio- nem] induritiam (-ciam a) seu indurationem (-aci- a) V a. The close relationship between P R Y Aa Sa can be illustrated with the help of, for example, the following conjunctive errors: 42, 8 Nam om. P R Y" Aa Sa, 47, 51 celesti om. P R Y1 Aa Sa, 56, 72 ad om. P R Yl Aa Sa; 51, 69 summam] diuinam P R Yl Aa Sa. As can be seen, these errors have been corrected in Y. This is also the case in several other passages in the text, for example, 33, 36 where Y1 instead of quasi seems to have had sicut,1 a reading also found in P R Aa Sa. V — a I have earlier assumed that a was copied from V (by a certain Jacobus).2 That this really was so seems probable for several reasons, not the least the following: In Rev. 1 o, 146 a provides a corrupt text; for instead of et neruis corporis perforatis ad cor ascendebat there is in a only dabat. In V et neruis corporis perforatis ad cor ascen takes up precisely one line and then continues on the next line with debat. The error in a has probably arisen because the copyist happened to skip a line in the original and erroneously wrote dabat instead of debat.3 In several places the text in V has been corrected. In such cases the text in a usually agrees with that in V2, for example, 1o, 111 manum eius] eius manus V1 eius manum V2 a, 15, 20 dulcia] suauisima et dulcia V' suauia et dulcia V2 a. Thus, more exactly, the original of a would seem to have been V in a corrected version (V2). An objection that 1 In the manuscript there seems originally to have been sicut, which has been changed by Y2 so that si has been crossed out and cut rubbed out and then qi (= quasi; see Cappelli 308) has been written in rasura; cf. below, p. 167; Rev. 56, 79 and 109. 2 See above, p. 154, n. 5. 3 Cf. Bergh 44 (concerning 05 H). 
 
 
 
 
 167 may be raised against V being considered the original of a is that in some places a has the correct reading whereas V has an erroneous reading, for example: 1 o, 39 mirarer a: intrarer V, 1o, 11 o seui tortores a: senitores V. These two rather trivial errors in V (due to the confusion of mi and int, of u and n and by haplography of tor, respectively), could without difficulty have been corrected by the scribe of a in his own manuscript. It is more remarkable that a, which—apart from its own omissions—seems otherwise to have the same omissions as V, does not omit velle, left out in V in Rev. 26, 128 (habent voluntatem numquam v elle luxuriari) and which in view of voluntatem there seems no reason to add. If we do not wish to assume that the scribe of a added velle himself—possibly after consulting another manuscript than V—then the discrepancy between V and a in this passage of the text must be explained in some other way. It is theoretically possible that, for example, V and a derive from a common original (r?; see above, pp. 155 f.) in which velle had been entered when the a copy was made but which was missing when V was transcribed.4 Bearing in mind the situation in Rev. 1 o, 146 (see above, p. 166) I am, however, more inclined to consider a a copy of V. The possibility that V is a copy of a is out of the question, among other reasons because a has a number of lengthy omissions not found in V, for example, 1 o, 64 quod pedes mei pre exultacione om. a, 16, 28 sq. Cui diabolus respondit om. a, 54, 34 sq. accendit ... secum (XIII verba) om. a. If a, as I believe, is a copy of V then its date of origin can be fixed at the earliest to 1415 when V was written.5 Aa —P R Y Sa In the manuscripts P R Y Sa there are a number of conjunctive errors which reveal their dependence on a common source, but one by which A5 has apparently not been influenced, for example, 26, 32 quasi (quasi angelus et Da Jas tamquam C d7) om. P R Yi Sa, 31, 41 et eciam (eciam om. Aa C d Fal) om. P R Y1 Sa, 33, 24 homo (amor La) om. P R Y1 Sa, 41, 9 sum om. P R Y1 Sa, 41, 138 misericordia om. P R Y1 Sa, 41, 167 qui es om. P R Y1 Sa, 48, 28 sq. qui sunt in mundo (ante qui) om. P R Y1 Sa; 26, 37 et commixtione sexus] mediante commixtione sexus (post inflammarentur v. 38) P2 (in m.) R Y1 Sa om. P1, 26, 54 per deitatem meam] de deitate mea8 P R Y1 Sa om. Aa, 26, 136 implebo] impleo P R Y1 Sa, 37, 18 mundo] quodam loco P R Y1 (quodam eras. mundo in ras. scr. Y2 loco lin. del. Y2) Sa, 51, 66 deitati (diuinitati Aa)] ueritati9 P R 171 Sa, 59, 16 curans] curando P R Y1 Sa. These errors common to P R Y Sa have all been corrected in Y, as was the case with the earlier indicated errors that Y1 shared with P R Aa Sa." In all probability Cf. above, p. 155 (V), n. 12; Bergh V, pp. 51, 57 f.; Eklund—Leby 22, 25-29. See above, p. 153. 6 Cf. above, p. 143. 7 Cf. below, p. 198. 8 Cf. above, p. 144 (per potenciam deitatis: de potencia deitatis). 9 This error has probably arisen in the source common to these four manuscripts by a confusion of the abbreviations for de and uer in the original of this source. 1 0 See above, p. 166. 4 5 
 
 
 
 
 168 all the corrections in Y (the Y2 readings) in the above-cited places have been made by the scribe of Y himself, as far as I can judge from my microfilm of the manuscript. For correcting he seems to have used a manuscript closely related to V since in the places in question V has the correct reading and in other places V and Y have common erroneous readings, for example, 26, 125 videre] habere uel videre V a Y, 41, 119 intrabit V Y (om. a) instead of ingredietur, 59, 48 scilicet] Primum scilicet V Y2 Primo scilicet a Primo C11 d. As mentioned above, Y originally belonged to the monastery of St. Girolamo di Quarto sulla Riviera, outside Genoa, where Alfonso, Birgitta's Spanish confessor, spent the last years of his life. It is not improbable that Y's corrective exemplar was "originalia Alfonsi" in the above monastery.12 V a Y Sa It appears from what has been said above that Y shares certain errors with V a. In my material I have further errors illustrating the mutual relationship between these manuscripts and Sa. The following instances can be given: Prol. sulcabatur M., 85 reiciebat" V a Y Sa instead of reiecerat, Rev. io, 89 caro sulcabantur, 41, 142 deum V a Y Sa (and R) instead V a Y Sa instead of carves of me. Y — Sa There are some errors in Y Sa indicating that both manuscripts have been dependent upon the same source, for example the following: 2, 55 libenter om. Y1 Sa, 13, 26 loquitur sine eo] sine eo Sa sine eo est Y1. In the latter case loquitur was presumably missing from the presumptive source; I interpret est as being a conjecture made by the Y scribe. With the help of the above-mentioned correc- tive original the same scribe could later correct the errors common to Y and Sa found in Y. As has already been mentioned, both Y and Sa contain individual errors which preclude the possibility that either could have been the original of the other or in fact of any known manuscript. In Sa, which is inferior to Y, there are a number quia (XLVI verba post quia), of lengthy omissions, for example, 33, 12-16 ipsi and some interpolations such as Prol. M., 120 credi] explicari Sa. Omissions are comparatively rare in Y. In those cases where they consist of individual words they have generally been entered into the manuscript by Y2. An omission in Y which is more comprehensive and disturbing to the sense of the text and which has not led to a correction is worth mentioning; namely, Rev. 47, 13o sq., where 16 words, loco ... occulto, are missing after occulto. The first of the omitted words, loco, is also missing from the pi manuscripts V a P R Sa as well as from N and ja1. 11 There seems originally to have been If • (=scilicet; see Cappelli 336) in C which has later been changed to f° (=primo). 12 See above, pp. 156, 157; cf. Bergh 36 ff.; Bergh V, pp. 50-52, 54-59; Eklund—Leby 25-29. 13 This error may have arisen under the influence of retinebat v. 84. 
 
 
 
 
 169 In conclusion another error may be mentioned which gives us reason to believe that not only Y and Sa, but also P have been dependent upon the same source. In Prol. M., 5, Y1 and Sa and P2 (exc. m Ab deest I 0)14 all lack audiunt; however, this has been entered into the margin by Y2. In the text itself, P has subauditur audiunt, a reading which probably was a marginal note in P's immediate original. The scribe of P obviously misinterpreted the note and entered it in the text. The P scribe has made the same sort of misinterpretation in Prol. M., 2 where after nostra he has entered Habentur hec uerba Jeremie •V • capitulo in the text. It is quite clear that these words derive from a manuscript where they had been entered as a marginal note to the introductory words (Stupor et mirabilia etc.) in Prol. M.15 Their original position is to be found in the best of the y manuscripts, y,'6 while x Zi La and y2 (deest f) have the note entered in the Incipit or the rubric to the Prologue." It seems probable that the note in question found its way to P, directly or indirectly, precisely from a y manuscript. If this was the case this would be a further support of the validity of Bergh's hypothesis, based on the examination of the text in Rev. VII and V, that P was subjected to an influence from y.18 How- ever, I must point out that there is no such influence other than this to be seen in Prol. M. and Rev. I in P. P — Y As mentioned earlier, on the basis of certain exterior criteria two art historians, Dr. Daneu Lattanzi and Dr. Carl Nordenfalk, have maintained that P and Y must have a common original. A critical study of the text of Prol. M. and Rev. I handed down in these manuscripts has led me to draw the same conclusion.19 Above are cited several examples of errors joining P R Y Sa.2° Of the errors binding P and Y together may be mentioned 27, 45 eciam] autem eciam P Y1 (autem lin. del. Y2). In both P and Y there are individual errors, as we have already seen. Here are given some of those found in P: 2, I 1 filius lei et om. P, 1o, 25 templo (temp/um D1 h 1 s Da ja pa; cf. above, pp. 140, 142)] corde P, 1o, 78 passionis Filii mei] passionis mee P, 15, 49 totis viribus] uoluntatem suam P1 uoluntati sue P2. Thus neither of these manuscripts can have been the original of the other. In my opinion the common source of P and Y can have been the direct original of Y, but it was most probably only indirectly a source for P. The direct original of P would seem to have been a manuscript, now lost, to which had been added 14 On Ab see below, pp. 200 f., 211. 2. 15 See above (A), p. 148, n. " See above, p. 77; cf. w, p. 68 with footn. 44, and K in the critical app. to Prol. M., 2. 17 See above, pp. 58, 6o, 64, 68, 71 , 74, 75; of the other y MSS, X and 10 lack the note (see above, pp. 67 and 76). We do not know what the original situation was in Z and v since both these defective manuscripts lack all, or large, parts of Prol. M.; see above, pp. 7o, 72 f. 18 See Bergh 59 f., Bergh V, pp. 54-57; cf. Eklund—Leby 28 f.; above, p. 151, n. 6. 19 Cf.

 170 RS and a Birgitta Vita.21 These two latter texts are found in P but are missing from Y. The scribe who entered them at the end of the presumed original of P was most probably the author of the above-mentioned marginal notes that have infiltrated the text of P and also the author of certain other textual interpolations found in P (e.g. 1o, 78 and 15, 49; see p. 169).22 A R Aa As I mentioned earlier (p. 148), A lacks both the errors characteristic of [31 and those characteristic of p2. However, the manuscript shares certain errors with the 131 manuscripts R Aa, for example, 2, 38 istum (ante honorem z suum j La y2; cf. above, pp. 84 f.)] mundi A R, 2, 44 dabo tibi om. A R, 10, 162 post inclinabatur add. et sic emisit spiritum et tunc (cf. Rev. VII 15: 24; Vulg. Matth. 27, 50) A R Aa.23 It is scarcely possible to demonstrate the exact relationship between these three manuscripts. This also applies to the mutual relationship between most of the other p, manuscripts, as should be clear from the above discussion. The following stemma probably gives a fairly accurate illustration of the relationships within the X31 group: sa 2.

The y readings that P has in Rev. V and VII may also be the result of this scribe's interpolatory work; see above, p. 151, n. 6. 23 The relationship between the three manuscripts is also apparent from their almost identical Incipit to Prol.

 171 Amongst the prominent people said to have acquired copies of Birgitta's Revelations in Rome about 138o was a certain frater Petrus de Burgundia Ordinis minorum, theologus maximus.1 It has not been possible to establish with any degree of certainty who this eminent theologian was.2 On the other hand, it is certain that the transcription of the Revelations he took with him from Rome was, according to tradition, this very cod. B, since at the beginning of the manuscript on f. 1v there is a detailed note in Latin, entered at the earliest in 14923, giving the history of the manuscript. Amongst other things it is stated that the above-men- tioned Petrus de Burgundia had the Revelations written in hoc presenti libro perga- meneo qui pre manibus habetur et eundem detulit in burgundiam. Not long after this manuscript had come to Burgundy it was sent, according to the note, to Maria, Duchess of Cleve, Countess of Merk and daughter of John the Fearless of Burgundy. It was sent so that this Maria, who was wife of Adolph II of Cleve, would become an even greater admirer of St. Birgitta on reading the Revelations. Maria intended to found a convent in Birgitta's honour in Marienboem (or Marienbaum, situated between Cleve and Wesel). On the completion of this convent—ca. 146o Maria is said to have donated the manuscript to the convent.4 Another note entered in the manuscript on f. I55r, at the earliest in 1517,5 states that the manuscript was damaged when the convent caught fire in 1513.6 From the two notes it is evident that cod. B—at least in the i5oo's—was identified in the convent as Petrus de Burgundia's copy of the Revelations. That they are one and the same manuscript is also maintained by Schack 227 and Rose 891. B is dated to 1379 by Schack but—a remarkable inconsistency—to the "XV. Jh." by Rose. Westman 22 f., footnote 2, is unable to share Schack's opinion for two reasons: firstly because the note in the manuscript that Schack bases See Undhagen, Une source, p. 225, lines 15 ff.; above pp. 25 f. Nordenfalk 384, footn. 46, refers to one of the suppositions expressed by Dr. 0. von Feilitzen that the theologian in question could be Petrus ad Boves (Pierre aux Boeufs, born ca. 1368, f 1425; see LTK, 8,352). Since he is given as not being born until 1368 he would have been only about ten years old at this visit to Rome, so he can hardly be identical with Petrus de Burgundia. 2 Since in this note, which is found printed in both Schack 53 f. (note 58) and Rose, loc. cit., are mentioned Revelation books qui modo imprimuntur, by which is probably meant the Ghotan edition of 1492 (see above, pp. 1-4) or the Nurnberg edition of 1517 (cf. below, footnote 5); Westman, loc. cit. 4 On Marienboem and Maria of Cleve (f 1463) see Nyberg 15o ff.; Nordenfalk 384; cf. Und- hagen 58. That B belonged to the convent named is also evident from a provenance note on f. 2r: Sum Mariae ad arborem Fratrum Eremitarum; cf. p. 131. 5 Since in this note, printed in Rose 892, is mentioned the Nurnberg edition of 1517; see above, P. 4 (with footn. 22). 6 Anno 1513 ... conflagravit Curia Sacerdotum ad Arborem Marianam incendio, cuius vorax flamma etiam Bibliotheca non abstinuit ... et huic Romano caelestium Revelationum Manuscripto, quod vides, damnum intulit 7 As has already been pointed out by Westman 22, footnote 2, Schack has given the manuscript an incorrect mark; cf. Kraft 65 who does not seem to have understood that Schack in fact identifies B with Petrus de Burgundia's transcription of the Revelations. 2 
 
 
 
 
 172 his opinion on was written after 14928, and secondly because the handwriting in B is decidedly against a dating of the manuscript to 1379.9 According to West- man B can be a transcription of Petrus de Burgundia's copy from 1379 of the Revelations, carried out in the I400's. Nordenfalk 384 f. has also arrived at the latter conclusion but on other grounds. He has studied the pictures and the historiated initials of B which "show that the model was an Italian manuscript of exactly the same type as the one in the Morgan Library" ( =Y; see pp. 156-162) and which "betray as plainly as anyone can desire a female hand—that of one of the Birgittine nuns of Marienboem". Thus Nordenfalk is of the opinion that B has been "exe- cuted in Northern Europe not earlier than ca. 146o", when the convent at Marien- boem was founded. It is possible that Nordenfalk's conclusions concerning B are quite right, but there are no certain criteria that the manuscript came into existence just in Marienboem as late as 146o. On the other hand, can B really be identical with Petrus de Burgundia's copy of the Revelations from the end of the 1370's as the tradition in the Marienboem convent and Schiick and Rose contend ? Like Westman and Nordenfalk I consider this cannot be the case. My opinion is based, however, on a fact that seems to have escaped their and other scholars' notice: the manuscript ends on ff. 285va-298vb with a detailed alphabetical table of contents beginning Abbas bonus ... and ending xristianorum status ..., written by the same hand as that which has entered the rest of the contents of the MS. In my manuscript material the same table is found in only four other manu- scripts, b, d, Gb and Q, written in 1445, 1467, 1474 and the mid-I 400's, respectively.19 If the table of contents had been in the Alfonso redactions, it would presumably also have been handed down in the other manuscripts that originate from those redactions, viz. the p manuscripts.1-1- As this is not the case there are no grounds for believing that Petrus de Burgundia's transcription of the Alfonso edition would have contained the table of contents mentioned. Consequently, B can hardly be identical with this transcription. On the other hand Petrus' transcrip- tion may have been the original of B with the exception of the table of contents which the scribe of B can have compiled himself or have copied from another manuscript; for example from b which also has belonged to the convent of Marien- boem.12 Should the table of contents in B be found to have been copied from b, The fact that the note was made at the earliest in 1492 does not exclude the possibility that it can transmit an older and quite correct tradition. dates the manuscript 9 Westman cites Collijn who-clearly on the basis of the handwriting in B - to around 1425, a dating that Bergh 41 considers to be probably too early. Godel 28 dates it to the first half of the I400's. in my opinion one cannot, on palaeographic grounds, completely exclude the possibility that B was written as early as the end of the 1300's; see, however, below. 10 See pp. 131, 193, 209 and 121. 11 See pp. 52 f.,148-195, 200 f. 12 See pp. 131 f. I have not compared thoroughly the text of the tables in B, b and d and therefore do not know in detail the mutual relationships between these three manuscripts as far as this text is concerned. I presume, however, that the writer of d can have copied the table from B, a surmise which seems plausible in consideration of the close relationship that seems to exist between B and d 
 
 
 
 
 173 then 1445 can be established as a terminus post quem for the origin of B. 1467 can be established as a terminus ante quem if, as I suspect, the scribe of d copied his table of contents from B. If B originates from before ca. 1460, the year Marien- boem was founded (see above), then this manuscript can no more than b have been written in this convent. It is not impossible that both manuscripts derive from Marienwater in Brabant,13 mother convent of Marienboem. Since the Revelation text in B can be assumed to have been copied from Petrus de Burgundia's copy of the Revelations and thus represent the second Alfonso redac- tion from ca. 1380, the manuscript has its decided value in connection with estab- lishing the extent and formation of the text in that redaction. The contents of the manuscript, which have been entered with great care by the same scribe throughout, are the following: f. I. Originally a fly-leaf that was pasted to the inner side of the front cover; on its verso page there is a detailed account in Latin of the history of the manuscript, probably entered at the beginning of the i5oo's; see above, p. 171, footnote 3. ff. 2ra-3vb: List of the rubrics in Rev.

 175 but since the discovery of the Krakow manuscript Fb from 13861 this is no longer the case. C consists of 256 parchment leaves 29 X 19 cm, besides which there are 4 paper leaves, two at the beginning and two at the end. There are 28 quires, most of which comprise 8 to 1 o leaves. The recto pages of the leaves are numbered in pencil in modern times. Besides this numbering there is an older, probably origi- nal, numbering in Roman numerals, I—LXXXI, in the upper left hand corner of the verso pages of ff. 12-92.2 The present mark of the manuscript, W. 318, shows that it has previously be- longed to Ferdinand Franz Wallraf (1748-1824), Professor at, and Chancellor of, the University of Cologne.3 A note entered on the two paper leaves at the beginning of the manuscript during the I7oo's by Simon Broichausen, monk and priest of the Birgittine cloister Syon (Sion) in Cologne,4 gives the previous history of the manuscript. Among other things5 he says that he was given the manuscript as a present on 13th February 1703 by a relative, Stefan Broichausen, who in his turn had received it from the abbot of the Cistercian monastery Altenkamp6 where the above Stefan was himself prior.? That the manuscript belonged to a Cistercian monastery in the diocese of Cologne is clear from the following provenance note entered in the upper margin of f. 3r by a hand contemporaneous with that which has written the text on the same page: Liber monasterij ordinis Cysterciensis Colonien- sis dyocesis. Reuelaciones sancte Brigitte.8 Several hands have shared the transcribing of C.9 The first half (to Rev. IV incl.) was completed on 3rd October 1388 (see below, the Explicit after Rev. IV), 1 See pp. 204-209. This numbering, which begins on the same page as Prol. M. (see below), has earlier been ob- served by Kraft 68 f., footnote 2; a similar "double numbering" occurs in cod. q; see pp. 134 f. See ADB, 40, 764-766; Leyh, Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, III: 2 (1957), p. 16o; Loftier, KOlnische Bibliotheksgeschichte im Umriss, 41 f., 44 ff., 61 f.; Loffler—Kirchner—Olbrich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, II, 243 f., s.v. Köln; cf. Kristeller 131, s.v. Köln. 4 On this monastery see Gesammelte Nachrichten, 175 f.; Nettelbla 60-67; cf. Collijn, Birgitta- litteratur, 88 ff. 5 He further points out certain dissimilarities between the content of the Revelation books in this manuscript and that in the printed editions, and he informs the reader that septimus liber contine- tur sub quinto ante sextum and concludes by saying: Consequitur ergo hunc manuscriptum esse Copiam primorum originalium aut transuinptorum. Simon comes to this conclusion not because Book VII is placed after Book V in C, but because the manuscript only contains seven books as originally did the Alfonsian corpus Reuelacionum according to the same informant; cf. pp. 16 ff. 6 On Altenkamp (Vetus Campus), the oldest Cistercian monastery in Germany, founded in 1123 and situated near Rheinberg north-west of Dusseldorf, see DHGE, it, 618-623; LTK, 2, 906, S.V. Camp. He was abbot 1726-1733; see DHGE, II, 620. 8 To the right of this there is written in red ink IV 54, presumably the mark of the manuscript in the above monastery. 9 According to Westman (p. 264) they should be 4 in number, according to Kraft (pp. 68 f., footn. 3) at least 6. 2 
 
 
 
 
 176 the remainder on 14th January 1393, according to the Explicit after Rev. VI (see below). Of importance in the classification of this manuscript is, among other things, the Incipit to Rev. I (see below) as it is only found in one other manuscript, d.10 Further, of note is that Rev. VI and VII have been entered in inverted order. The rubricator has thought that Book VII was a part of Book V as he has given them the common column title V9 ( =quintus) and after Book VII, which has no Incipit, he has written Explicit liber quintus (see below).11 Contrary to Rev. I—IV and VI, Rev. V and VII lack a list of rubrics (see below). Contents if. 3ra-4vb: List of the rubrics in Rev.

This manuscript belonged to the Scottish antiquary and librarian David Laing (f 1878), who donated it to Edinburgh University Library. During the 16 and I7oes it seems to have belonged to the Fitton and Mainwaring families.' There is no information in the manuscript as to where, when or by whom it was written. Borland assumes, presumably correctly, that it originates from England and the I400's. "The hand is very clear and uniform, ... but no initials have been inserted by the original scribe. Historiated initials to the books have been very crudely executed later, possibly in the 16th century ... in Scotland."2 Of note is that the scribe consistently uses the form Brigitta, which is the usual form in French and German MSS., and not Brigida, the predominant form in English and Italian manuscripts.3 Contents ff. i ra-3rb: Prol.

 178 H =New Haven, Yale University Library, MS. Z. 109.031, cent. XV, ff. 3 ra 5 6 va (401). Lit.: Bergh 41, 44 f., so f.; Ekwall 86; Germont—Polain, Cat. de la bibl. de Riant, I (1896), 36o (N° 2472); Kraft 65, footnote 2, Montag 40; De Ricci—Wilson I, 166 (N° 24); Selmer. H is a parchment manuscript consisting of 401 originally unnumbered leaves of size 33 X 26 cm. The text is entered in two columns per page by the same hand throughout, probably in the mid-I400's. According to Selmer, the manuscript was written by a prior of the Birgittine monastery Marienforst at Godesberg, near Cologne.' The handwriting is clear and easy to read. The chapter initials are usually beautifully illuminated. A later scribe has tried to make paragraph divisions (a, b, c, d etc.) in the margins of the various chapters. Throughout the Swedish saint's name is spelt Birgitta. According to De Ricci—Wilson 1166 this MS. "belonged (ca. 186o) to the Bischofliche Seminar-Bibliothek at Hamburg; sold in 1882 by C. H. Becker2 of Nordlingen (Cat. 155 n. 52) to Comte Paul Riant3 (L. de Germont and L. Polain, Catal., I, 1896, p. 36o, n. 2472), whose Scandinavian library was given in 1896 to Yale by Mrs. Henry Farnam". Two leaves are missing at the beginning of the manuscript. This also seems to be the case at the end of the manuscript. The first two leaves have contained a list of the rubrics in Rev. I 1-53 (up to and including figura multa). The end of this 1 In 'Die spatmittelhochdeutschen Bestandteile der lateinischen Birgitta-Handschrift der Universitatsbibliothek zu Yale und ihre Dialektbestimmung', Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, ed. by P. W. Long, vol. 51, Menasha, Wisconsin, 1936, pp. 37-58, Carl Selmer has studied the language in and published the brief Birgitta vita and prayer in German that are included in the manuscript (see below, footnotes 6 and 7). Selmer, 57 f., considers that he is able to establish the following amongst other things: "Die lateinischen und deutschen Teile sind von einer Hand geschrieben", "Die mhd. Teile der Yaler Birgitta-Handschrift sind in ihrer Grund- lage in rheinfrankischem Dialekte geschrieben", "Der Schreiber war Freiherr von Greifenclav, ehemaliger Domdechant von Mainz, der in diesem Kloster" (i.e. Marienforst) "von 1456 bis 1467 Prior war." Whether the manuscript was really written by this von Greifenclav and in Marienforst I am not certain. In any case it seems to me that Selmer's argument p. 57, "Sein" (i.e. Greifenclav's) "Dialekt und seine Schreibart waren rheinfrankisch, das ja die Grundlage der deut- schen Teile darstellt", is not especially convincing. On the other hand I consider it obvious that the manuscript was written in Germany, probably in the mid- 400's; cf. Selmer 38, 57. 2 De Ricci—Wilson state that the MS. was sold by C. H. Becker; this must be incorrect. The seller was almost certainly Beck, a well-known family of booksellers from Nordlingen; on this and the world-renowned "C. H. Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung" see, for example, Neue deutsche Biographie, Hrsg. v. der historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, I, Berlin, 1 953, 697 f. 3 Concerning this famous bibliophile and Swedophile see, for example, I. Collijn, 'Journal de voyage en Scandinavie d'un bibliophile francais', Melanges offerts a Marcel Godet, Neuchatel, 1957, pp. 187-199. Count Riant was a close friend of the noted Swedish librarian Gustav Klemming (t 1893) who dedicated his Latinska stinger (see my Bibliography; cf. below footnote 7) "ILL. COMITI P. RIANT RERUM SUECICARUM STUDIOSISSIMO". They were both devoted admirers of Birgitta. 
 
 
 
 
 179 list, covering the rubrics to Rev. I 53 (from mirabilia incl.)-6o, fills f. 3r. There then follow: Prol. M., Rev. I (with textrubrics) and—with both list and text rubrics—Rev. II—V, ES, and Rev. VIII (57 chapters),4 IV Or. (not numbered but supplied with text rubrics),4 Rev. VI—VII;5 at the end of the MS. we find a Vita beate Birgitte (in German),6 some prayers and verses to Birgitta in Latin and a prayer in German.? I = Cremona, Biblioteca Governativa, MS. 131, cent. XV, ff. 10r-48v (237). Lit.: Bergh 41 f., 45-51; Mazzatinti LXX (1939), pp. 98 f. Cod. I consists of 237 parchment leaves 19,8 x 28 cm large. These are, with a few exceptions (e.g. ff. 10, 20, 23o), unnumbered. On the other hand the number of the Revelation book entered on the respective pages is written in the upper margin of the recto pages. To the right of this is the number (numbers) of the Cf. Oa p. 190. Book VII covers—as does its list of rubrics-32 chapters; cf. Oa p. 190 with footnote 21. 6 After the heading Jncipit vita beate Birgitte in teutonico sub breuitate compilata follows a brief Birgitta-vita, Sancta Birgitta ist geboren von den konigklichem stamme von gotlant czeichen, filling ca. two pages of the manuscript; cf. footnote 1. Below the heading Oracio de sancta Birgitta follows first a prayer in Latin which fills just over a page: 0 Amantissima christi sponsa perhenniter viuit et regnat deus in celis Amen. FElix regnicola paradisi sancta Birgitta sponsa dei grata ... cum to viuere perpetue (parts of this prayer are also to be found in Ba, see p. 124, footnote 5). V 0 Birgitta pro nobis tuum rogita sponsum ut digni efficiamur 4 5 promissionibus christi. Oremus. Collecta. DEus qui ecclesiam tuam deuotis mentibus exequamur Per dominum nostrum iesum christum etcetera. This collecta has been borrowed from the office composed in honour of St. Birgitta by Nils Hermansson (Nicolaus Hermanni), Bishop of LinkOping, beginning Rosa rorans bonitatem; see Schtick, Rosa rorans, 52; NISL, I2, 198 ff.; Undhagen 8; Undhagen, Un acrostiche, 96 f.; cf. Nordenfalk 389. Then there follows a prayer in German of about the same length and with Oracio de beata Birgitta in teutonico as heading. The prayer begins with Gegruset and ends with der heilige geist Amen; cf. above, footnote 1. It is succeeded by yet another Oracio de beata Birgitta in Latin, consisting of the following passages found in the office in honour of St. Birgitta written by Birger Gregersson (Birgerus Gregorii), Archbishop of Uppsala (see Undhagen 6 ff. with ref.): Gaude Birgitta miserie (=Birg. Greg. off. Birg., Ant. XIII p. 207, 16-19). 0 Birgitta mater pia ... celestia (= ib., Sequ. str. 9 p. 234, 17-22), 0 sponsa christi reddens ... mitissima (= ib. Vers. allelui. p. 232, 4-7). The prayer ends with V . Ora pro nobis beata Birgitta . . . via recta. Collecta ut supra (= the end of the seventh part of the last prayer; see below; Klemming, Latinska stinger, 46). Then follow, after the heading 'tem Oracio, two prayers which are almost identical with the ones appearing in Oa (see p. 19o, footnote 23): AWe Birgitta ... ad sanctorum fer collegia. V Ora pro nobis etcetera Collecta. DEus qui secreta celorum ... Per christum dominum etcetera.—The last prayer in the manuscript has as a heading De sancta Birgitta. In the margin it is given as having 7 parts (Hec oracio habet septem partes); namely, De ortu et origine eius, De desponsacione eius, De austeritate vite eius, De viduitate eius, De peregrinacione eius, De infirmitate et morte, De ipsius commen- dacione. This prayer has been published in full by Klemming, Latinska sdnger, 39-46, based on cod. Vindobonensis 1316 in the Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek (cf. Nordenfalk 383). In cod. H, where two leaves seem to be missing at the end, only prima pars and the beginning of secunda pars are preserved: SAlue decus feminarum Gemma lucens matronarum Cuius fecit et cul-<torem>. Each pars consists of a number of four line stanzas with trochaic rhythm and rhyming according to the following pattern: a a a b. 
 
 
 
 
 i8o chapter (chapters) found on the respective leaf (page).' Judging from the appearance of the figures both these forms of numbering have been done at the same time as the writing of the actual text. There are a number of gaps in the text, which points to the extent of the MS. having been originally considerably greater. Further, a number of quires seems to have come out of order in binding; this is particularly noticeable in Rev. IV—VI. The text is written in one column per page by three different hands. Hand 1 has written: ff. 1-6, hand 2: ff. 10-165, hand 3: ff. 166-236.2 It is clear from the concluding words of the MS. on f. 236", in Middle English, Jesu3 he that graciose ys haue mercy a pon hym pat wroth thys, that the third hand is that of an English scribe. This anonymous copyist has thus been responsible for the transcribing of Rev. V—VIII +the long note at the end of the MS. (see below). There is nothing in the manuscript to indicate the nationality of the other two scribes.4 Neither is there any information on the origin or provenance of the manuscript. However, this much can be said, that I must have been written after Birgitta's canoniza- tion 7th Oct. 1391, which is mentioned at the end of the MS. (f. 236"; see below). Though safe criteria are lacking it would seem to be possible to date the MS. to the first half of the 15th cent. Concerning its provenance Mazzatinti LXX, p. 99, makes the following statement: "Il codice proviene certo dal Convento di S. Agos- tino" (i.e. in Cremona) "poiche nella chiusa ... e narrato the l'ordine fondato da S. Brigida e chiamato di S. Salvatore fu posto sotto la regola di S. Agostino."5 Contents ff. 1r-6v: Vita beate Birgitte written by Birgerus Gregorii (Birger Gregersson), Archbishop of Uppsala.6 i See, for example, f. I0r, where in the middle upper margin there is I and to the right of this I,. ih' indicating that the leaf contains the text of chs. 14 and 15 in Book I. Chapter numbers are dis- continued from f. 166 incl., probably because there was a change of scribe here. 2 The text entered by hand 1 is not on my microfilm of the MS., but is given by Mazzatinti LXX, p. 99, as having been written by a hand different from those of the other two sections of the text. The difference between the second and third scribes' handwriting is very marked; for example, the letter e is written by hand 2: e and by hand 3: e . I have found this latter letter type in several English manuscripts from the I400's; see Undhagen 38, n. 4, 122, n. 5. ' Written in the left margin. 4 In this connection I would, however, like to mention the fact that two monks from the English Birgittine cloister of Syon visited Italy in the 1420's to procure transcriptions of Birgittine texts. A large part of the contents of cod. Harleyanus 612 (= L) is clearly based on these very transcrip- tions. Since I shows itself to be closely related to L there is reason to suspect that the contents common to I and L derive from the same Italian source, even though L is separated from this source by at least one intermediary, the transcription by the two monks; see pp. 182-185, 197, 199. 5 See p. 181; cf. p. 3, n. 12. The fact that the rule of the Birgittine Order was subordinate to the rule of St. Augustine is naturally not in itself evidence that I came to Biblioteca Governativa in Cremona precisely from the library of the Augustine monastery in the same town. It is, however, very probable since many other MSS. in the Bibl. Govern. most certainly have belonged to the men- tioned monastery; see Mazzatinti LXX, pp. x ff., xx ff.; cf. El, xI (1931), 828.

 181 ff. 7r-9v: blank.6 ff. 1 or-48": Rev. I 14: 3-60 : Io (accedit ... placuerit). The 13 first chs. and the beginning of ch. 14 are missing from the manuscript. The missing text of Rev. I and, I presume, Prol. M., was probably entered on a separate quire consisting of approximately 10 leaves; i.e. a quire of about the same size as that which contains the above-mentioned Birgitta Vita. The error may have arisen at the binding which was apparently carelessly done (cf. above, p. i 8o). The preserved chapters have text rubrics. The book ends with Explicit liber primus celestis reuelacionum dei beate brigide7 principisse de regno suecie diuinitus reuelatus. Rev. II—VII (with text rubrics) then follow. The last Explicit reads: Explicit septimus liber6a reuelacionum dei beate brigitte7 principisse nericie de regno suecie diuinitus reuelatus. After Book VII there follows an account, in Latin, of where and when Birgitta died, was buried and was canonized and that deus .. . ei in visione spirituali multa secreta celestia reuelauit que conscripta sunt ... et collecta in vnum magnum volumen, that her Order Rule was called regula sancti saluatoris and est confirmata per sedem apostolicam sub regula sancti augustini etc. After this account, which opens with the words Cunctis christifidelibus pateat euidenter8 and which takes up most of the last page of the manuscript, there follow the scribe's words in English quoted above. J = Cambridge, St. John's College, MS. C.19, cent. XV, ff. I ra-6r, 27 ra_70rb (340). Lit.: Bergh 42, 45-51, 91, James 93 f. (N° 69). This manuscript is of parchment and consists of 340 leaves. These are un- numbered with a few exceptions, for example, f. 27 where Rev. I begins. On the other hand on the recto pages there is usually the number of the book found on the respective pages. The text, which seems to have been written by the same hand throughout, is entered in two columns per page except for the list rubrics (see below) and the end of Prol. M. which are entered in one column per page. Worthy form "un fascicolo a se in seguito premesso e legato insieme ad altro ms." Whether this quire containing the Birgitta Vita has been bound into the manuscript by mistake—at the cost of the missing chs. from the beginning of Rev. I (see below)—or has been deliberately placed there is not easy to decide. That it is a question of an intentional arrangement seems to me, however, very probable. It is true that I do not know of any other MS. with the same distribution of the contents, but on the other hand I find it quite natural to have a biography of the author of the Revelations precede the Revelations themselves. An indication of such a redaction is found in the granted remarkable Incipit to Rev. I in C and d: Jncipit vita sancte Brigide (resp. Brigitte) princi- pisse regni swecie (see pp. 176, 193). According to Mazzatinti LXX, p. 98, the corresponding In- cipit in I reads: Incipit Vita beate Birgitte quam composuit beatus Birgerus archipiscopus Upsalensis. The Vita itself begins Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter and ends to autem domine miserere nostri. deo gratias. This Vita is included in Birger Gregersson's Birgitta Officium in the form of 9 lecciones; see Undhagen 185 ff. Its presence in I was unknown to the present author when he published this officium in 196o. 6a Cf. above, pp. 16 ff. 7 In the Incipits and Explicits in the manuscript the name form Brigida is found only in the Explicit to Rev. I and the Inc. to Rev. II, in all other cases the form Brigitta is used; cf. Und- hagen 171. 8 The same account is found—with certain divergences—also in other MSS., e.g. 0 and cod. Ups. C 17; see Undhagen 39 with footnote 4. 
 
 
 
 
 182 of note is the arrangement of these rubrics, which are to chapters in Rev. I—VII and ES i-6 in J, since they have been collected in one place at the beginning of the manuscript, between Prol. M. and Rev. I (see below).1 The list rubrics are given consecutive numbering within the respective books, but moreover they have been numbered consecutively from Rev. I 1 to Rev. VII r incl. According to this numbering the latter chapter is nr. 412. Like 0, J seems to have originated from the English Birgittine convent of Syon, probably during the first half of the 1400'5.2 Contents ff.

James 93; Undhagen 36 ff.; above, p. 92, n. 40. 3 In front of Swecie and above the line there is the sign +, probably written there by a corrector wishing to indicate that something (de regno; cf. below the Incipit on f. 3v) is missing from the text. 4 I would like here to draw attention to the following: the rubrics to Rev. IV 18 and 19 (accord- ing to Gh) are missing from the list. The prologue to Rev. V with adherent rubric has been entered before the list of the rubrics in Rev. V; cf. Bergh V 68 f., 97 f. Book VII has, contrary to what Bergh 42 states, a list of rubrics (ff. 24Y-26v). However, the rubric to ch. 27 (according to Gh) is missing. Of the text rubric to this ch., only the beginning is written out; cf. Bergh 196, the crit. app. Here the rubric to ch. z8 (according to Gh) is missing. 6 In Rev. VIII the rubric as well as the text of ch. 27 are missing; cf. footn. 5. Of the chapters in Rev. VIII that have been "borrowed" from the previous books in Liber celestis (see pp. 22 f., 29 f., 1 01 f.) only the beginning is given, then there follows a reference to the corresponding ch. in the previous text where the respective chapters are written in full. The same arrangement is found in, for instance, Gh; see p. 110, n. 68. As is seen, there are in J wo lists of rubrics to ES, covering 6 respective 7 chs. 
 
 
 
 
 183 note 55; Schiick, Ant. tidskr., 5, 415 ff.; Schiick, Samlaren, 8 (1887), 158-175; Undhagen 36, footn. 2; 39; Weibull; Westman 27, 269 f. This manuscript, which is included in the Harleian collection) of the British Museum, is remarkable in many respects. In size it surpasses all other Revelation manuscripts known to me. Its 3o3 parchment leaves are no less than 54,5 X 38 cm. The text, entered on if. 2ra-3o2rb by the same scribe throughout, is divided into 14 books which altogether cover 1202 columns. Right from the beginning these columns have been numbered; however, some errors have been made. Besides this numbering there is a folio numbering carried out in modern times. The manuscript L was first made known to Swedish scholars in 1887 by Martin Weibull in his essay 'En vigtig handskrift till Birgittaliteraturen' (in HT, 7, pp. 88-99). This scholar maintained that L was a direct copy, written in 1416 or 1427, of an original record of Birgitta's Revelations kept in Linkoping Cathedral.2 This opinion did not long remain unchallenged. Already in the same year (1887) Schiick published 'Den nyfunna Birgittahandskriften' in Samlaren, 8, pp. 158-175. In this essay, which was very critical of Weibull, Schiick was able to show that L was written in England later than 1427. A more comprehensive description and a more exact dating of the manuscript was given by Schiick 1895 in Antiqvarisk tidskrift for Sverige, 5, pp. 415 ff.3 He showed among other things that L originated in the Birgittine convent of Syon, probably in the 1440's and certainly between 1435 and 1457 (op. cit., pp. 424 f.). Schack bases this dating on two facts: I. L contains a defensorium of Birgitta's Revelations which its author, the English Abbot Galfridus of Byland (see p. 184, footn. 5), sent to the Bishop of London in 1435 during the synod of Basle.4 2. L is both named and cited by Thomas Gascoigne in his Liber veritatum, written sometime between 1433 and 1457.5 In L the "usual" corpus Reuelacionum has been increased by a large number of Revelations and other Birgittine texts, the majority of which have been copied from originals from Italy and Sweden.6 Contents? f. I: blank; two parchment pieces containing a table of contents have been pasted on to f. Ir. 1 This collection has been so named after the famous British statesman Robert Harley (166'- 1724) who laid its foundations; see, for example, British Universities Encyclopaedia, XII, 558; DNB, XXIV, 399-406; cf. Collijn, A&P, p. XVII; Weibull 88. 2 Weibull 9 1 . 3 Cf. Collijn, ASP, XVII ff. 4 After this defence there follow in L two other defensoria written by a certain Bishop Reginaldus. Schtick makes no attempt to identify him. I consider it not impossible that this bishop is identical with Reginald Pe(a)cock who was created bishop in 1444 (see below, p. 184, n. 15). If this is the case the date of origin of L can be put more exactly between 1444 and 1 457. 5 On Thomas Gascoigne (t 1458) and Liber veritatum see Undhagen 38-40 with footnotes; cf. below (0), p. 185. 6 Cf.

XIV (Jncipit liber XIIII" The numbers within brackets refer to column numbers in the manuscript (see above, p. 183). The appearance of supplementary material in L, which is after all a i3 manuscript (see pp. 52 f.), may seem surprising, but can easily be explained since we know that a great deal of the contents of L derives from sources outside of see above, the references in footnote 6; below, p. 218. 10 Bergh 42 incorrectly states that Rev. VII in L covers "pp. 376-409": these figures refer to the columns and not to the pages of the manuscript. The equivalent folio numbering is 95vb_ iO4ra. 11 As mentioned above, p. 23, this prologus constitutes ch. 8 in ES. 12 See Hollman 55; cf. Ekwall 37, n. 24; 38. 13 In the Celeste viridarium, which is a compilation of Revelations made by Alfonso, are included SA (cols. 531 ff.) and IV Or. (cols. 627-634, ff. I58"-I6ova); cf. above, p. 24, n. 94. 14 Book XI contains RS (in prima persona; see pp. 2 f., n. 12), a large number of Extray. and Rev. IV 26; see Hollman 55 f. 18 The defensoria included in Book XII have been written by Cardinal Adam Easton (see above [Ga], p. 127 with footnotes 7-9), "Galfridus from P., abbot in (the Cistercian monastery) Byland (in Yorkshire, England)" (defensorium Galfridi de P. Abbatis de Bellando [----Bellalanda; cf. Graesse- Benedict-Plechl and Sleumer s.v. Bellalanda], f. 184rb), and a certain Bishop Reginaldus (defen- sorium Reginaldi Episcopi, f. 189va). In the manuscript, the text of Adam's defence is incomplete, since the text of articuli 33 - 47, which should have been entered on ff. 179ra-18 ivb, is missing. I have no details concerning Abbot Galfridus. His defensorium, which appears also in Ba (see pp. 124 f.) and in cod. Ups. C 518, (cf. above, p. 103, n. 12), was probably compiled at the beginning of the 1400's. In any case it was, as mentioned above, ready in 1 435; cf. HOjer 208, 258, n. 8; Westman 278, footn. 2. Who this Bishop Reginaldus was, I do not know with certainty. It is possible that he is identical with Reginald Pe(a)cock, Bishop of St. Asaph by papal provision 22 April 1444. On this self-willed and pugnacious bishop see DNB, XLIV, pp. 198-202; Emden III, 1447-1449; LTK, 8, 1098; above, p. 183, footn. 4; cf. Gascoigne, Liber veritatum (ed. Rogers), pp. 15, z6 ff., 208 ff., al. 16 Besides the texts that Collijn has edited in A&P on the basis of L and other manuscripts, this book also contains a number of suggestions for the canonization of Birgitta that had been set forth by Magister Johannes of Spain, Magister Matheus of Krakow, Cardinal Philip of Alencon and Magister Johannes of Basle, letters and petitions in favour of Birgitta's canonization plus Pope 8 9

This manuscript has been described in some detail by Undhagen (see above) who dates it between 1424 and 1458. He bases this dating on the following facts: The manuscript belonged to the well-known theologian Thomas Gascoigne (1403-1458), Chancellor of Oxford University, who entered several notes in the manuscript; for instance, one on f. 175" in which he mentions the copy of the so- called Liber attestacionum belonging to Syon Abbey. This copy can be dated to 1424.1 0 would seem to have been copied on Gascoigne's behalf from a now lost exemplar in this Birgittine convent founded in 14152. He later donated 0 to Balliol College.3 0 originally consisted of 225 parchment leaves. Of these, f. 1 (containing the beginning of Prol. M.; see below) is missing. By mistake two leaves have been numbered Io3; consequently, the succeeding folio numbers are a unit too low.4 It is worth pointing out that the lists of rubrics to Rev. I-VII +ES (7 chs.) are collected after these books, an arrangement that I have not found in any other Revelation manuscript.5 Contents f. 1: is missing. f. 2ra-2va: Prol.

This owner of the MS. seems to be identical with a Benedictine of "S. Albans Abbey by 1465 ... As is seen, Rev. VIII is missing from the manuscript. However, several marginal notes entered by Gascoigne show that he was cognizant of both an eighth and ninth book of the Revelations. For example, on f. 174 (175)r, referring to ES he says: Jsta est epistola domini Alfonsi : quondam episcopi giennensis in hispania et postea solitarie viuentis. missa ad reges et continet ista epistola : VII capitula et post istam epistolam: esset scriptus. liber: celestis imperatoris scilicet cristi adreges. et est octauus lib er Reuelacionum celestium: sancte birgitte ostensarum et post ilium librum ad reges : sequeretur hic : lib er.

 187 Bachelor of Theology, probably of Oxford, Prior of Hatfield Peveral, Essex (depen- dency of S. Albans), appointed 1478".io In the upper margin of f. Ir an interesting note is to be found, entered by a later owner of Fa, the antiquary John Theyer (1597-1673) who had a collection of eight hundred manuscripts:11 Richardus Lavinghamus Author est qui Claruit Anno Domini 137o tempore Edwardi Regis. obijt autem tempore Ricardi 2di cui fuit valde charus. To the right of this the same hand has written Stupor et mirabilia, the opening words of Prol. M., which fills ff. I r-2v in the manuscript. This note shows, according to Warner—Gilson I, 179 f., "that John Theyer ... wrongly supposed it to contain not the revelations themselves but the lectures on them of the Carmelite Richard of Lavenham". How Warner—Gilson have been able to draw this surprising conclusion from Theyer's note, I do not know.12 In my opinion the note should be interpreted to mean that Theyer thought that the prologue beginning Stupor et mirabilia was written (Author est) by Richard Laven- ham. This is all the more likely since the prologue in Fa lacks the Incipit and the rubric that state the real author, Magister Mathias.13 In the Incipit to the Revela- beate tion books it is explicitly stated that the resp. books contain reuelacionum Brigide ... de regno Swecie (see above); consequently, it is somewhat unlikely that Theyer would have thought that Lavenham had written them. Oa = Katrineholm, Ericsbergs slottsbibliotek (Library of Ericsberg Castle), cent. XV early, ff. Pa—XXXIva (255). Lit.: Bergh 42-51; Nordenfalk 386-388. Cod Oa was completely unknown to loth-century scholars until 1961 when Professor Carl Nordenfalk published the first investigation of the manuscript and its illuminations in his essay 'Saint Bridget of Sweden As Represented in Illumi- nated Manuscripts', pp. 386-388. The MS. belongs to the library of Ericsberg Castle (not far from the town of Katrineholm and some 120 kilometres south-west of Stockholm). When it was acquired is not known,1 neither is it known when or where it was written. However, Nordenfalk has drawn the following conclusions (p. 388): "In a general way the illustrations recall South and West German Wolkshandschriften' ... A certain similarity also exists with the newly discovered Emden III (1959), 2077. DNB, LVI (1898), 13o. His name, Iohannes Theyer, is to be found in the lower margin of fol. 191v. 12 Cf.

As Nordenfalk pointed out, sev- eral ancestors of the present owner, Baron Carl Bonde, were bibliophiles who might have acquired the manuscript abroad; see Nordenfalk 387 with footnote 62. Concerning the Library of Ericsberg see Carlander, Svenska bibliotek, III, pp. 564-583; Ottervik—Mohlenbrock, Bibliotek i Sverige, pp. 23, 65.—I would like here to express my sincere thanks to the present owner of the manuscript, Baron Carl Bonde, who has had the kindness to send the manuscript to Lund University Library, where I have been able to study it in detail. 10 11 See 
 
 
 
 
 188 frescoes in the Augustinerkirche of Constance executed in 1417-1418 ... the manuscript itself may have been written about the same time ... at Constance2 in haste for some prominent member of the Council ..." My studies of the text of the manuscript have led me to about the same conclusions: Oa, which is very closely related to cod. H, written in Germany probably in the mid-I400's (se pp. 178 f.), most probably originates from Germany and from the beginning of the I400's. These manuscripts can be assumed to have been copied from a common original, but it seems more probable that Oa in a corrected form was the original from which H was copied.3 The manuscript consists of a total of 255 leaves divided into 12 quires. Each quire generally consists of ten bifoliate sheets of paper and two of parchment.4 The leaves are—with certain inconsistencies5—numbered with Roman numerals (i-ccxlix) entered in the upper margin by a hand contemporaneous with that which has written out the actual text of the manuscript. The text entered has got out of order, probably because of great haste in binding the MS. or because of uncertainty of the correct order.6 A corrector has tried to rectify this after the binding and numbering of the leaves of the manuscript (see be- low, footnotes 5, 6, 12-16, 18-20). The contents of the manuscript are as follows:7 ff. ra_ea: List of the rubrics in Rev. I: Jncipiunt Rubrice libri primi celestis reuelacionum dei beate Brigide, principisse Nericie9 de regno Suecie diuinitus reuelati. ff. 3ra—ova: Prol. M. ff. 4va-31": Rev. I (with text rubrics). Ch. 15 has by mistake been given the same rubric as ch. 14; this has, however, been corrected by the rubricator. The text of the Explicit has been entered twice. 3 vb_ 32": List of the rubrics in Rev. II. ff. 32"-52vb: Rev. II (with text rubrics). • • 53ra-54': List of the rubrics in Rev. III. ff. 54"-70rb: Rev. III (with text rubrics). The text of the Explicit ends in the middle of the right column of f. 70r. 2 Cf. Lehmann, Erforschung des Mittelalters (1941), pp. 253-280, on "Konstanz and Basel als Biichermarkte wahrend der grossen Kirchenversammlungen". 3 See below, p. 199; Bergh 44 f., 48 4 See Nordenfalk 387, footnote 63. Two leaves have been numbered iiii; the recto side of the second one has an illumination covering the whole page. Between ff. 16 and 17, 69 and 7o there is an unnumbered leaf without text. The verso side of the latter one is decorated with a painting covering the whole page. In numbering the leaves the following numbers have not been written out: 93, 97, 184-186. The leaves which should have had numbers 106 and 126 have been cut out of the manuscript. After the last numbered leaf (ccxlix) follow a further 8 leaves without numbering. Also ff. 109-125 lack text. 6 Contrary to Nordenfalk 386 (with footnote 59) I do not believe that this disorder is a result of a conscious "attempt ... to change the normal sequence of the books". 7 In the following description of the contents I use for the sake of simplicity Arabic numerals instead of the Roman numerals of the MS. The spelling Brigida (or Brygida) is used throughout Cr whereas the closely related manuscript H has the correct Swedish spelling Birgitta ; cf. p. 178; Undhagen 68, 75, 171; Undhagen, Un acrostiche, pp. 94 f. with footnotes 32-35, 39. 9 Changed from Nerecie.

HMV with rubrics in red.18 hic added later. n quinti in ras. 12 Above this introduction a corrector has later entered transposicio librorum quarti et quinti.—In the upper margin on f. 70r is written Rubrice Libri Quinti questionum. Consequently Bergh 42 is wrong in his assertion that Oa lacks a list of the rubrics in Book V. 13 Above the historiated initial U a correctorer has marked: Jsta pictura vacet hic et scribatur post prologum (cf. Nordenfalk 375, 386 with Fig. 38); cf. below, footnote 14. 14 In the left margin of f. 72v a corrector has written beside the yellow-brown initial U: pictura staret hic (cf. footnote 13). In the upper margin, written in red ink, is ymago, clearly a direction that the historiated initial U (Jsta pictura) mentioned above in footnote 13, should really have been placed in this latter position in the text. 14a See Bergh V, pp. 68 ff., 97-175. 15 The rubric and the beginning of the text of ch. I were originally entered in inverted order and separated by the following direction: Huius libri tabulam quere folio ccxxxviii et scribe hic. By tabula is meant the list of the rubrics in ES which has been entered on ff. 238vb-239ra (see below). Added after the end of ES 8 (... in secula seculorum Amen) is the following direction: Hic scribatur tabula capitulorum que in fine huius libri habentur folio ccxxxviii. These words are most probably to be interpreted as meaning that the list of rubrics to Rev. VIII which has been entered on ff. 239ra- 24oth immediately after the rubrics to ES should be entered after ES 8 and before Rev. VIII. That such an arrangement was intended is also shown by the following directions. The first, 10 Tabula capitulorum huius libri celestis imperatoris habetur in fine huius libri ffolio ccxxxviii sed hic scribatur, is on f. 95rb on a piece of paper with an illuminated initial on it (see footnote 17) and which is pasted into the manuscript. The other, Tabula autem huius libri que sequitur scribatur in principio libri, is on f. 238vb after the Explicit to Rev. VIII. Cf. below. 16 Ends on f. 1 o6vb with the words motu carnis; later Qui quidem labor has been added and—in the lower margin—quere infra folio ccxxvj. The remainder of ch. 34 (Quj quidem labor ...) does indeed follow on f. 226va, immediately after the last chapter in Rev. VII (see below). Ch. 34 of Book VIII corresponds to Rev. IV 74 in Gh where motu carnis is found in approximately the middle of § K.—Nordenfalk 386, footnote 59, states, incorrectly, that it is Book V that is divided into two halves entered in different places in the manuscript. 17 See Nordenfalk 376, 386 f., Fig. 37. 18 Or. III has by mistake been given the rubric to Or I. A corrector has crossed out this rubric and in the upper margin written Jsta rubrica vacat hic Et spectat ad oracionem que incipit Benedicta et venerabilis infra folio •c • lxxiizj° , further the correct rubric has been written in the left-hand margin; cf. p. 190, n. 20.

Chapter 58, which corresponds to Rev. VII 30, is missing from 0' as well as from H (see p. 179). After ch. 57 follows Hie sequuntur quatztor oraciones prima incipit benedic- tum 2a benedictus sis to domine. 3a domine mi iesu christe22 tia 0 domina mea etcetera plus details of where these prayers are entered in the manuscript. Thereafter follows Explicit liber celestis imperatoris ad reges. From this it is clear that the editor-corrector has wished to incorporate the four prayers in Rev. VIII; cf. footnote 20. ff. 2438 vb_ 24orb: List of the rubrics in ES and Rev. VIII (8 resp. 57 chs. with rubrics in brown). The list begins with Hic incipit tabula capitulorum libri celestis jmperatoris ad reges beate brigide prime?*isse nericie de regno suecie diuinitus reuelata (!). Incipit Epistola solitarii ad Reges; then there follow the rubrics to ES succeeded by Explicit prologus libri celestis Jmperatoris ad reges and (f. 239") Jncipit liber celestis Jmperatoris ad reges reuelatus diuinitus beate brigide principisse Nerecie (!) de regno suecie. ff. 24.0va_249ra: sz, beginning with Inc/pit prologus in Sermone Angelico de excellencia virginis.

Quintus autem superius habetur folio lxx° has been added later; cf. footnote 12. 20 In the left margin on f. 274 beside the rubric to Or. I a corrector has entered the following note: Jsta oracio cum sequente vacent hic et scribantur in fine libri celestis imperatoris cum alijs duabus oracionibus que ibi habentur (cf. above and footnote 18). Also in H the IV Or. are placed at the end of Rev. VIII; see above, p. 179. 21 The list of the rubrics in Rev. VII is missing. On the number of chapters in Book VII see Bergh 43, 88 f. 22 christe has been added later. 23 See Eklund—Leby 75-137. After the Explicit to SA follows a note, presumably entered soon after 1492, since the writer seems to have based his information in the note on the editio princeps, Gh. In the note there is, for instance: Sequitur hic alter liber jdest Extrauagantes reuelationes B Birgitte reuelate quas F<rater> petrus confessor illius in fide veritatis dixit esse illius etcetera Sunt Prefatum sermonem capita 11-6 jstis capitibus sequitur vita abbreuiata que incipit Benedictus sit deus sequntur 4 magne orationes eidem reuelate. Prima ... Secunda ... 3 ... Quarta Domina mea vita mea; cf. above. The mentioned Vita abbreuiata is placed in Gh after Extray., and the IV Or. follow after SA; see above, pp. 3 f.; cf. Nordenfalk 387.—Finally I would like to point out the presence of two prayers in Oa. They are entered on the upper half of a damaged leaf which in connection with repairs to the manuscript has been pasted to a new leaf and placed in front of f. 1. They read: Awe Birgitta sponsa christi vernans rosa mater egregia: nos per tua suffragia sanctorumfer ad collegia Ora Birgitta dominum ut post vite terminum aditus pateat celorum. Collecta Deus qui beate Birgitte celorum secreta pandisti : presta nobis eius meritis ut celorum secreta in agone videre mereamur per dominum nostrum iesum christum filium tuum. The same prayers are found—plus some others—at the end of cod. H, which is another pointer to the close relationship between the manuscripts; see Pp- 179, n. 7; 199. 
 
 
 
 
 191 As is apparent from the above, a corrector has given certain directions as to where the texts incorrectly placed in the manuscript should, according to him, be placed. He seems to be of the opinion that the correct order is: list of the ru- brics in Rev. I, Prol. M., Rev. I, Rev. II—V with a list of rubrics before each book, list of the rubrics in ES, ES, list of the rubrics in Rev. VIII (57 chs.), Rev. VIII (57 chs.) plus IV Or., list of the rubrics in Rev. VI, Rev. VI, Rev. VII (without a list of rubrics; see p. 190, footnote 21), SA. We find the same order for these texts in H which, however, also has a list of the rubrics in Rev. VII and completely lacks SA. c = Köln, Historisches Archly der Stadt Kan, MS. G.B. fol. 17, a. 1467, ff. 5ra- 35rb (274). Lit.: Archly I1 (1858), 741; Westman 271. Cod. c, which is now kept in the Historisches Archiv in Cologne, previously belonged to the town's so-called Gymnasialbibliothek (G.B.).1 Its original owner was, however, the Brothers of the Holy Crosse in Cologne judging by the prove- jste liber est fratrum sancte crucis in colonia. It is evident from nance note on f. the Explicit after Rev. VIII at the end of the manuscript that it was written in 1467 by a hermit (clusinarius) by the name of Rudolf.

It was begun, however, as early as 1461 according to a note in the upper margin of f. 4r: 1461 Hoc opus est ceptum, dum festum est gregorianum. Rev. I and Prol. M. thus would seem to have been transcribed during this latter year. The majority of the manuscript—i.e. up to and including Rev. VI—was ready 1462 (see below, f. 29I").1 In d, Rev. I opens with the same extraordinary Incipit as in C (see below). This fact combined with other internal criteria point to Rev. I and Prol. M. in d having been copied from C.2 Rev.

This place-name, which is written in the manuscript with the usual abbreviation for To, has been interpreted by Westman as Grama, a name I have not been able to locate. I presume that the word is to be interpreted as Grauia; see Graesse—Benedict—Plechl, Orbis Latinus, 11 (1972), p. 183, where six different Gravia are mentioned, situated in Brabant and in France. 10 clusinarius =inclusus, reclusus; see DuC s.v. clusinaria; cf. Heimbucher I, pp. 109-112. 1 Quoting some notes in the Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm made by the librarian K. H. Karlsson (t 1909), Westman 271 states that the manuscript was written in 1461; this was corrected by Bergh 42, who maintains that the correct year is 1467. Neither of these is completely correct, as is apparent from the above. Judging by Bergh 44, Rev. 2 The same relationship would seem to be the case for Rev. VII may have been copied from B; cf. (B) pp. 172 f., n. 12. 3 Cf. C p. 176. 4 This rubric is of some interest as Prol. M. is said to be a prologus in omnes libros reuelacionum; cf. above, pp. 38 ff.

Ei* m =Mainz, Stadtbibliothek, MS. 404,1 cent. XV, ff. 3ra50rb (407). Lit.: Bergh 43, 48-51, 89; Westman 271.1 As far as I can see there is no information in the manuscript as to where or when it was written. Many of the manuscripts in the Mainz Stadtbibliothek belonged previous to 1803 to the University library of that town. The manuscripts in this latter library mainly consisted of such as had belonged to different mon- astery libraries in Mainz before 1781. Of such libraries, that belonging to the Carthu- sian monastery was the most important in the Middle Ages.2 It is, however, un- certain whether m originates from their monastery.2 a The manuscript may be dated to the first half of the 1400's. Cod. m consists of 407 leaves, but the occurrence of certain gaps in the text indicates that the manuscript was originally somewhat larger. Thus at least o n e tibi plura,3 leaf, containing the text of Rev. V 13 E (in.) secundum deitatem after f. 220, and at least one leaf, containing the majority of Rev. VI 109 (multi- caritate.), after f. 298, are missing. With respect to the rubrics in m it loquio may be pointed out that Rev.I—Ill only have list rubrics, Rev. IV, V and VII both list and text rubrics, Rev. VI and VIII plus ES, SA and IV Or. only text rubrics.4 Besides the numbering of the folios, which was obviously done in modern times 9 See Cnattingius 28 f.; Nyberg 69 ff.; Undhagen 37 ff.; cf. above, p. 182, n. 2. Cf. pp. 187 (Fa), 191 (c), 195 (0), 177 (E), 185 (0). This manuscript is in all probability identical with that which Westman 271 calls "MS. 206— (38)" according to information given by Dr. I. Collijn. But the fact is that there is only one MS. containing Birgitta's Revelations in Mainz' Stadtbibliothek and that is number 404; see Bergh 43. See LOffler—Kirchner—Olbrich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, II, 400; cf. LTK, 6, 1300- 1305 (esp. 1303 f.). 2a What is certain is that m is very closely related to Ab which may indeed be its original; see below, pp. zoo f.; above, p. 51. $ The missing text probably covered about half a column. The rest of this leaf may be assumed to have contained the beginning of the list rubrics to Rev. VI. If this is the case, another leaf must have been lost here containing the rest of the list rubrics to Rev. VI; cf. A.", p. 201. Concerning Rev. VI see n. 3. 1 °

 196 Of the p, manuscripts treated above, nine show a number of conjunctive errors indicating that these manuscripts derive from the same source. Below I shall call this source e and this will also denote the consensus of the manuscripts in question. To the e group belong: EIJL0Faceo.1 Common to e are amongst others the following errors: Prol. M., 138 fuit] est e (deest I 0), 16z suis om. e (in m. add. c2 deest I), Rev. 2, 28 sui om. e (deest I Fa), 15, 6o membra om. c (in m. add c2), 30, 20 offerunt] immolant e. The relationships within the e group Each one of the e manuscripts contains individual errors of such a nature that we can preclude the possibility that any one of them could have served as the original of any other manuscript in the group. The following examples of such errors may be mentioned: Prol. M., 141 fuerat (fecerat Da Ja pa; cf. above, p. 143) om. E (deest I), Rev. 32, 72 ab om. E, 37, 19 licet om. I, 44, 25 sq. in mundo om. I; Prol. M., 110 ingratis om. J (deest I 0), Rev. 32, 62 intrat om. J; Prol. M., 195 volens om. L (deest I), Rev. 1, 45 ante nulli add. ad placitum L (deest I Fa), 59, 102 non cessent a bonis instead of non bonis L; 1, 18 ad verticem (ad verticem capitisBa) om. 0 (deest I Fa), 16, 9 et racio om. 0, 36, 5 tedium om. 0; Prol.

Inc we find important separative errors in Rev. 41 where a number of sub-titles have been entered into the text, e.g. 41: 9 De papa (ante Nunc), 41: 18 De laycis (ante Ad), 41: 35 De iudicio beati petri contra predictos viros (ante Respondit). Finally, of the separative errors in o the following may be cited: Rev. 32: 3 in verbis meis, que audisti (post inuenisti) om. o, 44: 2 vocem ... raucam (X vcrba post raucam) om. o. In the case of certain e manuscripts the relationship is quite evident. This is especially true of j —e and to some extent even of I — L. J —e That J and e derive from the same source is clear from, for example, the follow- ing conjunctive errors: Prol. M., 171 lancea om. J e (deest I), Rev. 3z, 14 me om. J e, 44, 19 se (post sua) om. J e. Judging by the text handed down in Rev. 3: 3 which has been discussed above (pp. 145 f.) the source on which J and e seem to depend has been to some extent influenced by a 8 manuscript. 2 Other passages also indicate this, for example, 4o: R, 2 sq., where J J* e share the reading con- sumpcione (assumpcione b*), in my opinion an incorrect one, with the a MSS. F K b and also with Gh. The undoubtably correct reading consumacione (con- summa- A* M M* W Da ja g) is found handed down in the other a manuscripts (om. D Q h 1 s N N*), in 3 p MSS., A* (om. A) P* Aa Aa*, and in the y manuscript 1 2 Cf. Bergh 45 ff.; Eklund—Leby 29-32. See above, p. 145. 
 
 
 
 
 197 y.3 The other f3 and y MSS. (deest H* Z Ka f v) have conseruacione, palaeographi- cally a quite natural mistake, probably arising from a confusion of 9fisacibe (= con- sumacione) and 9fuacia ( = conseruacione).4 It is probable that the erroneous conseruare instead of consumare has arisen in a similar way in Rev. z8, 52. The erroneous reading is to be found in p (exc. J e) and y (seruare La om. Ka deest f j) while a (deest q) Gh and J e have the correct consumare.5 Presumably both consumacione and consumare were so written in the archetype that the copyists of the f3 and t hyparchetypes, respectively, independently of each other, misinter- preted the archetype text and wrote conseruacione and conseruare, respectively. As we have seen, both these errors were later corrected in a and in some other manu- scripts.6 I —L There are several conjunctive errors in I L which point to both manuscripts having been dependent on the same original, for instance: Rev. 31, 25 celi om. I L, 32, 8 honore] amore I honore amore L. In the latter place L is seen to have a double reading. However, above amore and in the margin L2 has put a cross (f) by which he has most certainly wished to indicate that amore was incorrect and should be crossed out. The origin of the error can be explained in many ways. It is possible, for instance, that honore in the original on which I directly, and L indirectly,7 depend may have been written so as to be easily misinterpreted as amore which the I copyist has in fact done. Uncertain whether there was honore or amore in the original the other scribe wrote both honore and amore. It is of course also possible that the double reading handed down to L may have arisen as a result of a misunderstood correction in the original of L. There are similar double readings in other places in L which may have arisen for the same reason, for instance: 7, 25 neruis (membris K deest I Z)] venis et neruis L. However, cer- tain discrepancies in the text must be attributed to the L scribe himself or, rather, to the person responsible for the L redaction of the Birgittine texts,8 for example 52: 4 to ipsa omnes excellis instead of ipse omnes excellit (precellit B z1).8. L o There is some connection between L and o. Neither of these two manuscripts has been the original of the other, as mentioned above, but both show certain points that seem to lead to a common source, e.g. Prol. M., 71 where L o have solidato entered after contra peccatores. The reason for this supplement is obvious. Instead of the correct reading perfecto (qualifying iusto in line 7o) all the e and p, MSS. (exc. J deest I 0) have in Prol. M., 71 an incorrect perfecte (clearly under- ' On consumacio=consummatio meaning consumptio see my Glossarium, p. 448. Cf. Cappelli 83.

 198 stood as qualifying the preceding mansuetudinis). Of the e MSS. it is only.). which— presumably per coniecturam—has the correct reading while in the source common to L o there has been a deliberate attempt to improve the text by adding solidato. In o, which is rather carelessly written and full of omissions, we also find inter- polated readings,9 e.g. 14, z6 pati o instead of magis ferre (3, n (magis sufferre b Gh sustinere W g); the other p2 MSS. have ferre (sufferre C1 H Oa). Thus, common to N2 is the loss of magis which would seem to have been deliberately removed from the [3 2 hyparchetype as it was interpreted as being pleonastic after the preceding mallent in the same sentence." Another interpolation is found in 45, 44 where o has replaced dabas by audiuimus. E 0 Fa c I have found no conjunctive errors in the e MSS. E 0 Fa c.11 Thus nothing can be said about their mutual relationship or their relations to the other e MSS. than what has already been pointed out above (p. 196), namely, that none of them can have been the original of any of the others. Regarding c it may be mentioned that it would seem to have a certain connection with H Oa as is apparent from, for example: 2, 24 earn ante paratam add. c2 H Oa (and w), 32, 22 est om. c H Oa (and Z).12 In Fa we now and again find a reading shared with the pi manu- script R, e.g. 31, 25 pura fuit] munda fuit R munda fuit et pura P. The mutual relationship between B C H Oa d m We have seen that in nine (3 2 MSS. there occur certain conjunctive errors which justify my assigning them to a special subgroup, e. Such errors have not been found in the rest of the f3 manuscripts, i.e. in B C H Oa d m. However, regarding their mutual relationship this much can be said: d is certainly a direct transcription of C in corrected form (C2), and H was in all probability copied from the corrected Oa (0a2), which should be apparent from the following ex- amples. C — d Already in my account of the contents of C and d I mentioned an important circumstance indicating a close relationship between the two manuscripts.13 We can conclude from the following conjunctive errors that d, which is about 70 years younger than C, is really a copy of the latter MS.: Prol. M., 44 non neget C d in- stead of concedat, 103 uidentur C d instead of aspiciuntur, 170 superbiunt] gloriantur et superbiunt C d; Rev. 1, 1 1 ledit] violat C d, 5, 41 cemento] muro C d, 32, 22 comparacio (delectacio H Oa) om. Cl post ad illam C2 d, 32, 38 propter om. Cl ad C2 d.14 These two manuscripts are, as we have seen, heavily interpolated. . Cf. Bergh 46 f. 10 See the app. sim. to Rev. 14, 25 sq. 11 Cf. Bergh 45-48. 12 Cf. Bergh V, pp. 59 f., 65 f.; Eklund—Leby 22, 31 f. 1$ See above, pp. 176, 592 f. 14 For the transcription of Rev. VII d seems to have used not C but B, or a manuscript closely related to B, as original; see Bergh 44, 48-5o; cf. Eklund—Leby 22, 29-32. 
 
 
 
 
 199 Oa — H The close relationship between Oa and H is revealed, for example, in the following conjunctive errors: Prol. M., 20 misericordie, virginis om. Oa H, Rev. I, 26 fregit Oa H instead of spreuit, 4, 12 tenere om. Oa H. The occurrence of certain individual errors in H indicates that this manuscript cannot have been the original of Oa. Such an error is e.g. 47, 131 ante quos quasi in occulto iaceo Deus om. H. Oa, or rather, 0a2 does not seem to contain any separative error compared to H. There is thus reason to believe that H was copied from Oa in corrected form. This is supported by the following errors: Rev. 3, 23 et (est Oa') maneant] id est maneant 052 H, 9, 7 post habueris add. omnia desiderabilia habes (cf. 9, 8) 0a2 H, 26, 49 sq. sed ... delectacio (XIII verba) om. Oa' habent 0a2 H plurimi codd.15 B m The examples of conjunctive errors in C d and Oa H, respectively, cited above are at the same time examples of separative errors compared to B and m (and the other manuscripts). In B and m we also find individual errors, e.g. 20, 16 sq. Ideo ... tua (VI verba) om. B, 32, 23 vera om. B, 32, 82 ab homine] a vino B; Prol. M., 43 sq. consequens ... concedat (XII verba) om. m. Consequently none of the four MSS. B C Oa m16 can have been the original of any of the other three.17 The examination of the p2 manuscripts has shown that these divide up into two subgroups, E I J L 0 Faceo (=e) and B C H Oa d m, respectively. The former group is kept together by a number of conjunctive errors and can there- fore be regarded as homogeneous, whereas the latter group lacks any combining errors and is therefore fairly heterogeneous. The relationships within f32 may be illustrated by the following stemma codicum: 132 J e 15 Cf. Bergh 44 f., 50; Bergh V, pp. 51, 65 f.; Eklund—Leby 49 f. 16 As for m's relation to Ab see below, p. 211. 17 Cf. Bergh 48-50. 
 
 
 
 
 200 The newly discovered MSS. As was mentioned above (p. 5o), nine manuscripts did not come to my notice until after the Latin text of this edition had already been established and was avail- able in galley proof in 1968. These manuscripts are: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Hb Kb. , I was informed of their existence by Montag (Ab— Eb , Gb Hb‘ )Westman (Kb) and Prof. J. Svennung (Fb). They will be presented below in alphabetical order (ac- cording to their sigla). I shall then try to determine their position in the tradi- tion—as far as this is possible on the basis of partial collations. Ab = Darmstadt, Hessische Landes- and Hochschulbibliothek, MS. 733, cent. XV early (?), ff. 2ra36vb (278). Lit.: Montag i oo f., footnote 4. A preliminary study of this manuscript from a microfilm has given the foll- owing results: A" consists of 278 leaves, judging by the consecutive numbering in the manuscript entered in modern times. Besides this numbering there is an older, probably original, numbering of the leaves. This is done so that—in the main—every Revelation book has a separate folio numeration. Using the older numbering as starting-point one can conclude that certain leaves are now miss- ing from the manuscript. Thus, for example, it is obvious that at the beginning of the manuscript two leaves, ff. 1-2, are lost. These probably contained a list of the rubrics to Rev. I. The leaf that in the older numbering is denoted as =4) has been given the number 3 by a later hand. Leaf 2 according to the same hand, corresponds to leaf 3 in the older numbering and leaf i seems to be a front fly-leaf. On this there is the following provenance note: liber monasterij beate marie virginis in boedinghenl Ordinis canonicorum Regularium.2 quem dedit eidem. venerabilis vir. dominus volmarus de attendarn3. pastor in wypperuoirdel. Qui vtitur eo, oret fideliter pro ipso. Below this note the same hand has entered the following information about the contents: Jn presenti volumine continentur libri celestium reue- lacionum facte (!) a deo beate brigide siue birgitte principisse de regno nericie et suecie numero. vij. The latter is not entirely correct, as the manuscript contains more than seven books of the Revelations (see below). The manuscript has thus earlier belonged to a Maria cloister of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine in Bodingen in Nordrhein-Westfalen. This cloister had received it as a gift from "Mr. Volmar from Attendorn, pastor of Wipperfiirth". A later alteration in the provenance note shows that the manuscript has changed 1 This probably refers to a cloister founded at the beginning of the moo's in Bodingen and belonging to the so-called Windesheim Congregation; see Heimbucher I, 427; below, footn. 5. 2 On the Augustine Canons and their order see Heimbucher I, 392 ff.; KLNM, 1, 28o-283. 3 attendarn=Attendorn, a town in Nordrhein-Westfalen; cf.

 201 owner: beate marie virginis in boedinghen has been crossed out and the words sancti Saluatoris in Evych have been written above. This means that the manu- script earlier belonging to the above-mentioned cloister in Bodingen was later on presented to the monastery of the Holy Saviour at Ewich (near Attendorn).5 This manuscript was acquired by the Hessische Landes- und Hochschulbiblio- thek in 1804.5 a Cod. Ab, which is closely related to m (see pp. 194 f.), was probably written at the beginning of the 1400's (according to Montag "um Ivo"). Its contents are as follows: ff. 2 (3)ra-3 (4)vb6: Prol. M. In the upper margin on f. zr there is: ,fin nomine patris et filij et spiritus sancti Amen. Jncipit prologus in libris celestibus reuelacionum dei beate brigide eis ab ipso missa diuinitus reuelatis. After the text of the prologue, Stupor et mirabilia fatebuntur, follow Explicit prologus in libris celestibus reuelacionum dei beate brigide princi- pisse niricie (!) de regno suecie diuinitus reuelatis and—further down in the same column— Ad honorem summj patris eiusque filij matris Incipit liber celestium Reuelacionum diuinitus reuelatarum Beate domine Brigide principisse Nericie de Regno Szvecie.7 In the upper margin of ff. zv-3v is Prologus in libris celestibus. ff. 4 (5)"-36 (37)vb6: Rev. I (without rubrics).8 The same hand that has entered the follow- ing text has written in the upper margin at the beginning of the Book: liber In nomine patris et filij et spiritus sancti amen primus. Jncipit liber primus celestis reuelacionum dei beate brigide principisse nericie de regno suede divuinitus reuelatus. The book ends with reuelatus. Deo gracias Amen. Explicit liber primus ete. ff. 37"-78": Rev. II-III. Both books open with a list of rubrics, but neither of the books has text rubrics., Of f. 51(15)6 only a little piece remains, containing some words from Rev. II 17: 6 and 17: 49-5o. Fol. 52(16)ra6 begins with Rev. II 18: 8 autem est illud. ff. 79ra-224": Rev. IV-VII.10 All of these books except Rev. VI have both a list of rubrics and text rubrics. Book VI only has text rubrics, but I suspect it originally had a list of rubrics entered on two leaves removed from the manuscript, ff. 1-2 in the older num- berings (see above). ff. 225"-232va: ES: 8 chapters with rubrics. In the upper margin at the beginning of the text the scribe has written: Ne scribam vanum. duc pia virgo manum (a Leonine pentameter)." ff. z3zv8-264": Rev. VIII (with rubrics). ff. 265"-275rb: SA (with rubrics). ff. 275rb_ 278°a: IV Or. (with rubrics). 5 This cannot have been done until after 1420 when the monastery at Ewich was founded; see Hermann Knaus, Vestfalische Handschriften in Darmstadt' (Durch der Jahrhunderte Strom. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Hessischer Landes- und Hochschulbibliothek Darmstadt. Zum oo- jeihrigen Bestehen der Bibliothek hrsg. von Erich Zimmermann. Frankfurt am Main, 1967, pp. 141- 178), 164-167 (this MS. is mentioned on pp. 166 f.). The Birgittine Order, Ordo sancti (issimi) Saluatoris, is, as is well known, closely connected with Ordo sancti Augustini; see, for example, Cnattingius 22 ff.; Hojer 165 ff.; Nyberg 2 ff.; cf. pp. 3, n. 12; 180 , n. 5. 5 a See Knaus, ib., p. 176.

This manuscript is now kept in the Bistumsarchiv in Trier, where it was transferred from the Cathedral Library12 which had been presented with it in 1804 by Dean, Count Christoph von Kesselstadt (born in Trier 1757, -I- in Paderborn 1814).13 Before he acquired it, it seems to have belonged to the Benedictine monas- tery of Abdinghof in Paderborn.'4 Cod.

I, 41, 34, and 36, the rubrics of which are entered in part. Decl. is found only to ch. 16. Fb = Krakow, Bibliotheca Conventus Fratrum Carmelitarum Discalceatorum, MS. 214 F, a. 1386, ff. I ra-45 vb (312). This is the oldest dated manuscript of St. Birgitta's Revelations.' It is evident 11 On this Petrus of Pisa see Undhagen, Deux manuscrits, p. 237. is evident from a stamp at the beginning of the manuscript: Ex Bibliotheca Ecclesie Cathedralis Trevirensis. 13 One can conclude this from the following provenance note in the lower margin of f. 2r: Ex libris Christopheri Comitis de Kesselstadt. Decani Paderbornensis Anno 1804; on this dean see F. Jansen, 'Der Paderborner Domdechant Graf Christoph von Kesselstadt und seine Handschriften- sammlung', in Sankt Liborius, sein Dom und sein Bistum, ed. P. Simon (Paderborn, 1936, 423 pp.), pp. 355-368; cf. Loffler-Kirchner-Olbrich, Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens, III, p. 431, s.v. Trier; Kristeller 205. 14 This assumption is reasonable, since on a fly-page of the manuscript there is written Liber sanc- torum Petri et Pauli in Paderborna. The patron saints of Abdinghof monastery were the apostles Peter and Paul; see LTK, 1, col. 12; 7, col. 1 345. 1 The existence of this MS. was completely unknown to me until 1969 when Professor J. Svenn- ung, Uppsala, informed me that he had learned of the MS. from Professor Dag Norberg, Stock- holm, whose knowledge was based on information received from Professor Marian Plezia, Krakow. He in his turn had learned of the MS. from Pater Michal, curator of the library in the Carmelite monastery in Krakow. I have since gained particulars of the manuscript from Professor Sylwiusz Mikucki and Dr. J. Zdrada, Krakow, and from Mrs L. Posten, Assist. Librarian of Lund University Library. I should like here to thank all of these for the information received. 12 This 
 
 
 
 
 205 from the Explicit on f. 310 (3i ir,2 Explicit Anno dominj M° ccc° lxxxvj° Sabbato in die beati panthalionis martinis, that the transcription was completed on the 27th July 13 8 6, the feast-day of the Holy Martyr Panthaleon. As Fb, because of its age, can be assumed to give the answers to several ques- tions concerning the textual history of the Revelations, it should obviously be studied in detail. I have only had time to make a quick preliminary examination of it, but will nevertheless give the results I have reached so far. Fb consists of 312 leaves of paper numbered in modern times.3 The text is entered in two columns per page. The manuscript, which is 3o X 20,5 cm, is bound between wooden boards covered with skin. The skin is now so worn that only faint traces of earlier ornamentation are discernable. The age of the binding is not known. The text, which seems to have been entered by the same hand throughout,4 is written in brown ink, with initials and rubrics in red. Parchment leaves containing Hebrew text are stuck on to the inn ersides of the covers. The manuscript, which belongs to the Carmelite monastery5 in Krakow, was moved to Lwow (ca. 30o km east of Krakow) in the 1840's, according to tradition in this monastery. There it was kept in the Bibliotheca P. P. Carmelitarum Leopoli.6 After the end of the Second World War in 1945 the manuscript was returned to KrakOw.7 Of its provenance and earlier history nothing is as yet known with any degree of certainty. On the basis of two records of court proceedings on f. 311 (312) where the year 1409 and the place Wschowa8 are mentioned, Professor Mikucki infers that Fb has belonged to one of the numerous monasteries to be found in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries. Fb, which seems to be closely related to q and S, has the following 2 This leaf has by mistake been marked as 310 in the MS. The correct number is 311. The error has arisen on f. 184 which should really have been numbered 185, since after f. 183 there is an unnumbered leaf which should have been marked as 184. The numbering of the succeeding leaves (from f. 184 incl.) is thus one unit too low. In the description of the contents following, the correct numbering is given in brackets. 3 In the MS. the last leaf is incorrectly marked as 311; see footn. 2. It is clear that the MS. originally contained at least seven more leaves; see below, p. 206 with footnotes 15 and 16. According to Prof. Mikucki the paper leaves have watermarks; but I have not received any information on their appearance. I hope to have the opportunity in the near future to study these and the manuscript itself in Krakow. 4 Certain corrections have been entered by a later hand. 5 On the Carmelite Order see Heimbucher II, 54 ff.; a Carmelite monastery is given as having been founded in Krakow in 1397; see ib., II, 61. 6 This stamp is found in three places in the MS., ff. I r, IO2r, 261 r. The catalogue of the MSS. in the Carmelite monastery in Krakow was lost during the Second World War. 8 Wschowa, the German name for which is Fraustadt, is situated ca. 90 km north-north west of Breslau (in Polish Wroclaw). I would remind the reader that both the town of Breslau and the Order of Teutonic Knights in Prussia were amongst those to have transcripts of Birgitta's Revela- tions made in Rome around 1380; see pp. 25 f., n. 107

The former would seem to have been entered on—at an estima- tion—three leaves,15 which are now missing after f. 50,16 the latter on four leaves, which are missing after f. 58.16 Of chs. 9 and I I only the beginning is entered and then follows a reference to Rev.

As is to be expected Birgitta, is called domina and not sancta in this manuscript, which originates from before her canonization; cf. p. 219, n. 19. 11 Concerning this Incipit text, which is to be found in rc Gh and subsequent printed editions, see p. 44, n. 40, and p. 229 (the crit. app.). 12 The second a in ras.; cf. the crit. app. of this ed., p. 240. 13 This Incipit text is also found in q and other MSS.; see pp. 136, 104, 117, 130. 14 At the foot of f. 58'13 there are the catchwords caritate mutua. 15 In estimating this I have assumed that of Rev. II 6 only the rubric and opening words have been entered, plus a reference to Rev. VIII 42, as is the case in q and K and other closely related MSS.; cf. above, pp. ioi, 104 f., 117, 136. 16 Fol. 50-13 ends with Rev. II 5: 1 qui veni and f. 51' begins with Rev. II 8: 38 Ve quia tam longa fuit; f. 58vb ends with Rev. II 19: 15 sic apes ex +the catchwords caritate mutua (see above, footn. 14) and f. 59' begins with Rev. II 22: 23 Electi dei. The person who has numbered the leaves of the MS. has presumably not noticed these lacunae in the text. 17 The same arrangement is found in q K and other closely related MSS.; see pp. 136, 104 f- 18 This reads briefly and to the point: Hic fuit sacerdos sepe ammonitus. The same short version is found in q (entered in the margin), M1, S and some other MSS. The longer version, which is approximately 11 times longer, is found in F K M2 N Q U5 and several other MSS. as well as in Gh and subsequent printed editions. 9 10

Ir-6r: The canonization Bull by Boniface IX of the 7th Oct. 1391: BOnifacius Episcopus apostolicam benediccionem Ab origine mundi ... (cf. 1, p. 134, n. 3). seruus seruorum dei ff. 6r--17v: Officium S. Birgitte, composed by Birgerus Gregorii, Archbishop of Uppsala: Sequitur Officium sancte Brigitte ...

Lat. theol. 1224, cent. XIV late, ff. Ira-16"a Lit.: Westman 271. This one-column paper manuscript which earlier belonged to the Jesuit College in Erfurt,' contains, amongst other texts, extracts from Rev. I-IV, VI and VIII., Of Book I only the following 23 chapters are found (all with text rubrics) entered on ff. Ir-16" in the following order: 1, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16 (without Decl.), 22, 26, 37, 43, 45, 55, 58, 38, 8, 9, 1o, 33, 36, 39, 47, 48, 56. For the classification of the nine MSS. presented above, the following method has been used: To decide quickly if the respective MS. belongs to class f3 or class r, those passages of the text, on the basis of which the other MSS. had been divided into these main classes," were collated. Then those passages which had been employed to subdivide the main classes of these MSS. were examined. Finally, certain 8 Published by Undhagen in 196o on the basis of other MSS.; see (g) p. 163, n. 7. The presence of the office in Hb was then unknown to the editor. The text of the office in lib shows that the manuscript can be classified as a so-called 0 manuscript. The text of the poetic sections represents the older recension (Rec. I); see Undhagen x18 ff., 134 ff. After the actual office there follows under the rubric 'tem oracio the prayer Brigitta regalis et amica dei specialis ... Amen. Solamen sis nobis Brigitta singulis; on this prayer, which is also found in s, see Undhagen 46 f.; above, P. 1 37, IL 9. 9 This is also the case in D Q h 1 s; see pp. 116, 120, 133, 134, 138. 1 0 See (Ga) p. 127, with footnotes 7-9. 1 This can be seen from the following provenance note entered in the upper margin of f.

 211 sections of the text, chosen at random, were compared, primarily for the purpose of discovering individual errors in the MSS. in question. The examination yielded the following result: Ab was shown to belong to the (3 class, the other eight to the n class, more closely defined, to the subgroup a. Ab In Ab are found the readings typical of p.1 The MS. belongs to the f2 group, since its conjunctive errors2 are also found in Ab. It is most closely related to m. Both of these MSS. have, for example, the following conjunctive errors: Prol. M., 68 firmatura Ab m instead of firmitas, Rev. 23, 5 sed] Cumque Ab m, 26, 21 stabili- tate] omni stabilitate Ab m, 6o, 9 post Quidam add. erant qui Ab m. In m, several individual errors occur which eliminate m as a possible original of Ab, e.g. Prol. M., 43 sq. consequens concedat (XII verba post contendat) om. m, Rev. 23, 73 remanet om. m, 37, 10 peccata om. m. I have not found any separative error in Ab as compared to m, and assume that it is therefore quite probable that m had been copied from Ab.3 It is theoretically possible, of course, that both Ab and m derive from the same original. Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Hb Kb Trb, belong to The remaining MSS. to be discussed here, Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Hb n. the n class. This conclusion can be made due to the fact that they contain typical readings,4 e.g. Prol. M., 144 fideliterque (deest Eb Kb), Rev. I, 47 si possibile esset ante pro (post adhuc Gb N; cf. below, p. 213), 6, 25 ingredi post ordinatam, 32, 27 eius concupiscenciam (deest Eb Kb) instead of de eius concupiscencia, 37, 9 reperiri (-re Db Hb inueniri Cb 13),48 47, 72 apponeretur (deest Db) instead of admoue- tur, 59, 1 o I post corde add. quod (deest Db Kb). As is shown above (pp. 53 ff.), the n MSS. are divided into two main groups, y and a. The manuscripts of interest here belong to the latter. They lack, namely, the specific y errors (see above, pp. 54-57) but contain readings typical of the a MSS., e.g. Prol. M., 128 audituros (-us Gb deest Eb Kb) instead of auditores,5 Rev. 3: 3 talem se ostendere, qualis est et post nisi add. (deest Db Kb),6 5, 59 quia dicunt (deest Db Kb) instead of dicentes,7 21, 31 de potencia (deest Db Eb Kb) in- stead of per potenciam,8 21, 5o post loquor add. scilicet peccatoris (deest Db Eb Kb),9 See above, p. 53 (with footn. 32). See above, p. 248. The same conclusion can be arrived at on the basis of the text of the two MSS. in Rev. V and SA; see Bergh V 59, 65 f.; Eklund—Leby 22, 49 f. 4 See above, p. 53 (with footn. 32); concerning Db Eb and Fb cf.

I have cited several examples of conjunctive errors in D Q h 1 s K N Ha ql. The same errors are found in Eb18 Gb Hb, which MSS. contain, furthermore, those above-mentioned (p. 141) errors common to D Q h 1 s K in Prol. M., 180 (deest Eb), Rev. 5, 16; 5, 27; 5, 29; 5, 77; 39: 6. It is, thus, evident that Eb Gb Hb derive from the same source as D Q h 1sKNHaq1. Furthermore, it can be stated that Hb is most closely related to the D Q h 1 s K group, with which it shares, among others, the above-named (p. 139) errors in Rev. 5, 63; 5, 68; 31: 12; 4o: 7; 54, 100. Its relationship, though, can be determined even more closely. Hb has the same errors as D Q h 1 s in Rev. 32, 30; 54, 100; 6o, 919 and has, just as these MSS., text rubrics in Rev. I only to chs. 55.20 The MS. is most closely related to 1 s, sharing with them, for instance, the errors mentioned above (on pp. 139 f.) in Prol. M.: 7; Rev. 1, 55; 5, 64; 19, 32; 44: 3. Concerning the internal relationships between Hb 1 s, it may be pointed out that Hb 1 have certain errors in common which are missing in s, e.g. Prol. M., 204 ab eodem religioso Hb 1 instead of per eundem religosum21 and Prol. M., 207 nomine Hb 1 instead of voce. I have not discovered any error in s which does not occur in Hb 1 as well. The occurrence of individual errors in Hb and 1, e.g. Rev. 4o: 3 Tunc illa decet sic (XI verba post decet sic) om. Hb and 31, 44 super 1 instead of ultra, shows that Hb cannot have been the original of 1 and that 1 most likely was not the original of Hb. The errors common to Hb 1 in all probability originated in an ancestor common to these MSS., which in turn may have been copied from s. This means that Hb and 1 could not have been written earlier than 1424, when s was written.22 Concerning Eb and Gb may be mentioned that both have added reuerenciam after matri mee in Rev. 3, 9. In the last-mentioned passage, the word honorem See above, pp. 90 f. See above, pp. 86-88. 12 See above, p. 1 45. 13 Of the 8 MSS., F M2 N (ante ait) Ba b alone have retained the correct reading; cf. above, 10 11 pp. 143 ff- 14 See above, pp. 144 f. 15 See above, p. 245. a MSS., F Ba b alone have retained quod.

Thus, text rubrics are lacking for Rev. 156 - 6o. 21 Cf. above, pp. 139, 142. 22 See above, pp. 137, 139. 16 See above, p. 145. Of the 17 
 
 
 
 
 213 was added after matri mee in D Q h 1 s K N23 and Bb Cb ja, but before matri mee in C d24 and after matri mee tamquam domine tue in M W g Bat Da pa Ta and a.25 Neither of the MSS. Eb Gb can have been the original of the other, since both contain a number of individual errors, for example, Rev. 1, 54-59 Anima ... habet (LIV verba) om. Eb,26 Prol. M., 127 queam om. Gb. There seems to be some rela- tionship even between Gb and N. They have, for example, the following omissions in common: Rev. 1, 6z sq. Ego sum verus propheta (post prophete) and 32, 8o cuius malicia est michi.27 In both MSS., si possibile esset was placed after adhuc in Rev. 1, 47.28 It should also be mentioned that these MSS. in Rev. I contain Decl. only to chs. 13 and 16.29 In both N and Gb are found individual errors, indicating that neither MS. was copied from the other.3° Bb Cb Db Ft, Kb The remaining MSS., Bb Cb Db Fb Kb, are most closely related to M S Ta and q, with which they share those above-named (p. 141) errors in Prol. M., 49 (multa [inulta S F"2] instead of mala; corr. M2 deest Kb) and Rev. 1o, 156 (0 Pater om.). The collations made have not enabled me to make a closer determina- tion of Bb's and Kb's place in the tradition. The latter MS. contains of Rev. I only 23 chs. and lacks Prol. M.,31 for which reason it hardly deserves more atten- tion here. Concerning Bb (written in 1454) it can be said that it is rich in separa- tive errors (e.g. Prol. M., 3 sq. in ulcionem peccatorum om. B", Rev. 5, 75 sq. et de verbis, que procedunt de ore meo, consolabuntur] cum B") and therefore cannot have been the original of any of the other, younger MSS. C" D" Fab My examinations of Cb Db Fb have yielded the following results. The three MSS. contain errors linking them together with especially M S Ta, for example, Prol. M., 55 a defensione iusticie] ad se ostendendum uel pusillanimis a iusticie defensione (defensione iusticie S F") M S Ta Cb Db Fb, Rev. 5, 22 et homo om. 1%11 S Ta Cb Fb (deest Db).32 Of these six MSS., C" Db come close to M Ta, and Ft), or more correctly, Fb2, to S, which can be illustrated by the following examples of conjunctive errors: Prol. M., 62 virtutum om. NI1 Ta Cb Db, 201 mulier om. Cf. above, pp. 139 and 147. Cf. above, p. 198. 26 Why these additions were made, can be seen in my Gloss., p. 450, s.v. deferre. 26 Besides, El) contains, of Rev. I, only 23 chs. (see above, p. 204), whereas Gb has the complete Rev. I text. 27 See above, p. 140. 28 See above, p. 53, n. 32. 29 See above, pp. 119 f., 209; below, pp. 218, 221, 22 4. 30 Such errors in GI' have just been taken up; concerning individual errors in N, see above, p. 140, the examples from Rev. 5: 16 and 56, 29. 31 See above, p. 210. 32 See above, p. 141.

 214 Rev. I, 19 in altari post immolatur M Ta Cb Db, 32, 34 ante euiden- ciam add. propter M Ta Cb Db, 32, 68 a] de M Ta Cb Db; 8, i o cum Maria virgine esse] in virgine esse Fbl ql ( ?)33 mariam virginem esse matrem S Fb2 illam mariam virginem esse Ml Ta Cb Db, 32, 41 esse in peccato] peccato 1141 peccator Ta Cb Db Ml Ta Cb Db, ex peccato S Fb, 48, 48 post ferendum add. iniuriam S Fb2. As regards the interconnections between M Ta Cb Db it must be stated first of all that Ta C" are very closely related. In these, we find among others the following conjunctive errors: Rev. 1o, 104 Cumque passionis (VII verba post percussionis) om. Ta C", 32, 56 leditur om. Ta Cb, 46, 9 Tu suauissima (VII verba post suauissimus) om. Ta Cb. Among the separative errors in C" may be cited Rev. 2, 17 sq. quia mea (XI verba post mea) om. C", 45, 44 sq. Tu tua (VII verba post tua) om es. That the MS. is interpolated is evidenced, for example, by Rev. 3, 21 ipsi] ipsi utique michi Cb, 30, 20 offerunt] immolant Z34 tribuunt Cb .35 Since Ta does not seem to contain any separative error against C", the latter manuscript was assumedly copied from the former.36 The following passage does not preclude this presumption: Rev. 28, 3o teneris portare om. Ta meruisti C" habebis 1V11 (exp. M2) eris portare in m. M2. A cross (f) in the margin by this passage in Ta indicates that the copyist was aware that the text was not correct. When the Cb copyist copied Ta, he attempted to amend the text by conjecture and wrote meruisti. The reading habebis in M is also in all probability to be regarded as a conjecture. The close connection between M and Ta can be suspected to be due to both MSS. deriving from a common original. That MS. seems to have lacked teneris portare in Rev. 28, 3o. Alternatively the words were written in such a manner that neither the M nor the Ta copyist succeeded in reading them.37 That the hand- writing and certain abbreviations in the original could easily be misinterpreted is indicated by, for example, Rev. 4, 8 where M has talia, while Ta (and C") has verba (in Ta written v'ba) instead of illa. In both of these passages, as well as in several others, where M Ta Cb have erroneous readings, Db has a correct one, which points to Db having been copied from a different original than M Ta.38 Since ID" of Rev. I contains only 29 chs., it is hardly likely to have been the original of M Ta which contain the whole Rev. I. That Fb(2) and S are quite closely related has already been mentioned and has been shown by examples. Their relationship can be illustrated further by the following examples: Prol. M., 40 malorum lin. del. Fb2 om. 5, 52 in iusticia sit F131 appareat in iusticia Fb2 (sit lin. del. appareat in m. ante in iusticia scr. Fb2) S, In q cum is written in rasura and mania in the margin. See above, p. 196. 35 On p. 211 above, footn. 4a, contamination has also been proven in Cb. 36 If this is the case, Ta must have been written prior to Oct. 27, 1441, when CI' was completed; see above, pp. 13o, 202. 37 The change of habebis to eris portare in M seems to have been executed by a hand other than that I call MI-. Perhaps eris portare should be considered as that hand's (M"s) interpretation of the text in the barely legible exemplar. 38 Concerning my classification of M Ta C" D" on the basis of the text of the above-mentioned 33 34 
 
 
 
 
 215 Rev. 15, 42 incipit portare Fin incipiet portare sic leuiter P2 S, 46, 9 post suauissima add. filius e contrario ad matrem F'32 S. These corrections in Fb (the Fs' readings) seem to have been made by the Fb copyist himself. Both of these MSS. are dated: S, which originates in the Breslau region, was finished in 1418, and Fb, whose derivation can be traced back to the same area, was written in 1386.39 In all prob- ability, Fb2 served as the original of S, but the agreement in their readings can be explained also in other ways. For instance, S can have been copied from some MS. which was also used as the secondary source of Fb, i.e. resulting in the Fb2 readings, unless S itself is identical with that MS. Of great interest is Fb's relation to q. As we have seen, Fb shares certain errors with q and M S Ta." But it is also clear that Fb has certain errors which do not appear in q, for example, in Prol. M., 55 and Rev. 5, 22.41 Consequently, Fib can hardly have been the original of q. Can the relationship be the opposite? Can Fb have been copied from q? As shown above (pp. 140 f.), ql has a number of errors in common with DQhlsKNHa. Since these errors are missing in Fb, it is obvious that the uncorrected q cannot have been the exemplar of Fb. As men- tioned above (p. 142), I have discovered only one individual error in q (Rev. Io, 144 cruce instead of cute). Similar to the closely related MSS. M S Ta Cb Db, among others, Fb has the correct reading. If Fb M Ta had been copied from q, or more correctly, from q2, we must conclude that all three copyists had in- dependently amended cruce to cute, which is, of course, within the realm of possibility. I find, however, that it is more probable that Fb derives from either a sister MS. of q, which lacked the incorrect ql readings, or a MS. with the help of which ql errors can have been removed." Having concluded the examination of the newly discovered manuscripts, I would like to try to illustrate, as far as possible, the relationships among all the 8 MSS. with the help of the following stemma. (pp. 117 with n. 4; 13o with n. 4; 202, 203) acrostic poem handed down in these MSS., see Und- hagen, Deux manuscrits, 237-239; Undhagen, Un acrostiche, 108-115. The relationship between the MSS. is, on the whole, the same in the acrostic poem as in Rev. I; in the latter text, however, it was possible to prove the existence of a source common to M and Ta, upon which Db did not depend. 39 See above, pp. 122, 205. 42 See above, pp. 213 f. 41 See above, p. 213. 42 See above, pp. 141 f.; cf.

 217 3. CLASSIFICATION OF MSS. ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SUPPLE- MENTARY MATERIAL IN REV. I The supplementary material added to Rev. I consists of declaraciones to chs. 3, 13, 16, 17, 23, 28 and 32.1 These "explanations" have been added by Prior Petrus in 1380.2 They have been handed down in full or in part to some Revela- tion manuscripts, i.e. to those I call the a manuscripts, either from the Vadstena manuscripts where they were first entered3 or via separate transcriptions of the Prior's collection of supplements.4 Through secondary influence from some a manuscript, certain Decl. would seem to have also been entered in 12' the hyparche- type from which T was copied. As mentioned above (p. 58), T contains Decl. 13, 16, 23, 28, and 32 in Rev. I, of which Decl. 28 was entered by the original scribe (Ti) in direct combination with ch. 28, and incorporated into the text. However, the other Decl. in Book I of the manuscript were entered by a later hand (T2) in the margins of the respective chapters. Most probably Decl. 28 had already been entered in they, hyparchetype. The Decl. which have been entered in Rev. I by T2 would, however, seem to have been copied from some other source. That T in its turn was the original of Ea and t will be apparent from the following study.5 In the yi manuscripts all the Decl. in Rev. I are left out, but there is no doubt that the editor responsible for the drafting of the yl hyparchetype was aware of the existence of the majority of these since all non-defect 1,1 manuscripts contain references such as Declaracionem require in fine sexti (libri), Declaracio in fine sexti etc. at the end of Rev. I 13, 17, 23, 28 and 32.6 The editor's intention that these Decl. should be entered at the end of Rev. VI was never fulfilled, as has been pointed out already. pp. 2 (with n. 4), 28 if., 52 f. See above, pp. 28 ff. The end of Decl. 3 (§§ lo-11) is a later addition which seems to appear first in Gh; see above, pp. 94 f., n. 52; below, p. 218. 3 In Gh the Prologue to Extray., § 3 (Hollman 113), states that declaraciones ... et addiciones, diligenti prehabita discussione, ipsis originalibus libris hinc inde pio conamine sunt inserte. If this in- formation is to be trusted it may mean that Prior Petrus' Decl. and Add. were entered in the ap- propriate places in the principal copy of the Revelations in Vadstena Cloister; i.e. in the Liber Al- phonsi, a manuscript of (3 type (see above, pp. 17 ff.), or, which seems more probable to me (see above, p. 29, n. 127 with further ref.), at least in transcriptions of this copy. However, as stated above (p. 29), there is no (3 manuscript preserved which contains the mentioned Decl. and Add., with the exception of L, which contains certain supplementary material; see above, pp. 52, n. 25; 284; below, p. 218. 4 Such a manuscript is Ua; see pp. 213 f. Cf. the Gh Prologue to Extray., § 2 (Hollman 113): 1 See above, 2 Petrus, prior Aluastri, ... aliquas ... reuelaciones extra libros originales pretermissas redegit seorsum in scedulas et sexternos; above, pp. 3o f., n. 238. 5 In the fourth y2 manuscript, f, which is defective, all the Decl. in Rev. I are lacking; see above, p. 61. 6 See above, pp. 3o f., n. 238, 32, 52 f., 64, 67, 68, 70, 72-74, 76, 77. In z and y2 there is a similar reference also at the end of Rev. I 16; see above, pp. 76 and 77, 11. 224. 
 
 
 
 
 218 Some Decl. are also found in the f3 manuscript L, which in Rev. I contains the Decl. 13,16, 28 and 32.7 Along with a great deal of other supplementary material, these supplements would seem to derive from transcriptions made in Vadstena Cloister in 1427.8 In addition to Gh (and succeeding editions; see above, p. 4), where the Decla- raciones attached to Rev. I are found, they also occur in the following manuscripts: Decl. 3 : 8-9: F Ba Ua Mb b (5); io—i 1: Mb (I); Dec1.13 :D F9KLMNQST2 W a B Da Ea ja pa Ta Ua Bb Cb Db Fb Gb Hb Mb bghlqst (30; Decl. 16: D F10 1CLAINQST2 Mbbghlst (30;h1 W Ba Da Ea ja pa Ta Ua Bb Cb Db Eb Fla Gb Hb Decl. 17 : D F KM QS W Ba Da ja Ta Ua Bb Cb Fb Hb Decl. 23: D F13 (2,6),1-4 bghis(22);12 W B a Da Ea ja pa Ta Ua Bb Cb Fb Hb 1..13 KMQS T2 Decl. 28:DFKLMQSTWBa Da Ea ja pa Ta Ua Bb Cb Db Fb Hb s t (28);14 Decl. 32:DFKLMQS T2 1 s t (28).14 bghlst bghl W Ba Da Ea ja pa Ta Ua Bb Cb Db Fb Hb Mb b g h Ua occupies a unique position among the Declaraciones MSS. since the sup- plementary material in this manuscript may be assumed to have been copied directly from the collection of Decl. and Add. that was handed over to Vadstena Cloister in 138o by Prior Petrus.15 Those manuscripts in which the Decl. texts agree with those in Ua may therefore be considered particularly valuable in the reconstruction of the original Decl. text. As I shall show, Ua in certain places offers readings which are not shared by any other manuscript. How these readings are to be appraised must be decided in each separate case. However, we cannot ignore the fact that Ua may contain errors arising from transcription or readings that can be explained as deliberate alterations of the original text. That the original text in Decl. has been subject to more or less extensive revisions when handed down will be obvious from my examination. 7 See p. 52, n. 25, and pp. 183-185 (with footn. 6 and 9). 8 See above, p. 8, n. i i; Bergh 74 ff.; Holtman 38-40. 9 Two versions; see above, p. 95; below, pp. 220, n. 23; 221, n. 31. 1 ° Two versions; see above, p. 95; below, p. 221, n. 32 and 34. 11 Concerning q see above, pp. 135 f. 12 Concerning Pa and q see above, pp. 129 (with footn. 4) and 1 35 f. 13 Two versions; see above, p. 95; below, p. 220, n. 22; p. 221, n. 35. 14 Concerning q see above, pp. 135 f. 15 See above, pp. 28 ff.; 113 f.; below, p. 224. 
 
 
 
 
 219 Let me first establish that any conclusion as regards the relationship between the a and y2 manuscripts on the basis of the text in Rev. I and the text in Prol. M. is also valid, with certain modifications, with respect to the text of their Decl. F Ba Ua b Gh Among other things, examination of the 8 manuscripts showed that there was a close relationship between F Ba Mb b and Gh.16 Such a connection can also be shown on the basis of the supplementary material. It should be pointed out, for example, that Decl. 3: 8-9 has only been handed down in F Ba Mb b Gh and Ua." Of these, Gh and Mb are the two most closely related. To the evidence already cited18 in order to establish that Mb was most probably copied from the five year older Gh, may well be added the following errors common to Gh and Mb: Decl. 3, 39 Fuit]Fuitque Gh Mb; Decl. 13, 44 contra iusticiam om. Gh Mb, 47 cum iustis om. Gh Mb. We may form an opinion of the mutual relationship between F W Ua b Gh if we take their versions of Decl. 3: 8-9 into consideration; this text is lacking in the other manuscripts (except Mb): Decl. 3, 36 vite] de vita F; domine Ua beate F b sancte W Gh; 37 hoc F Ua b om. Ba Gh. The omission common to Ba and Gh of hoc, superfluous in this context, would seem to have been made deliberately al- ready in the common original. In my opinion the original reading domine (referring to Birgitta), had been replaced in this original by sancte. The F b reading beate is probably older than sancte." That the Ua reading domine is the original appears very probable to me since in a corresponding place in Dep. cop. (3o Jan. 1380), 530 (in.) Prior Petrus uses the epithet domina about Birgitta.2° However, we may well ask if it is right in principle, in the reconstruction of the text, to choose the original Ua reading domine when it is not supported by any other Revelation manuscript where the discussed Decl. is handed down. In theory, it is possible that domine was changed to beate already when this Decl. was first entered in its context in a Vadstena manuscript. Thus F (and b) may possibly represent an original Decl. text, namely in so far as these supplements are concerned, handed down together with the respective revelation. However, we must not ignore the possibility that Prior Petrus' Decl. (and Add.) were originally attached to the appropriate chapters of Vadstena manuscripts, now lost, of the type represented by what is known as Liber Alphonsi,21 and that the text of the supplementary material may not yet, at that point, have been subjected to any more extensive See above, pp. 138, 143-147. See above, pp. 94 f., n. 52; 218. 18 See above, pp. I15, 138. 19 As for the use of the epithets domina, beata and sancta referring to Birgitta, see Andren, De septem sacr., 88-91; Bergh 86 f.; Bergh V, 21; Ekwall 31-33; Undhagen 119 f.; id., NTBB, 44, P. 33; cf.

 220 revision. It is quite clear that, in being handed down, the text of the Decl. in Rev. I has been changed in various ways for different reasons. Errors common to Gh Mb, F b, and Ba Gh, respectively, have been quoted above. Of the individual errors in F, apart from that in Decl. 3, 36 (see p. 219), should also be mentioned Decl. 23, 81 ad (ante suns) om. F; 23, 85 induracionis F instead of indeuocionis.22 In Ba are found the following separative errors: Decl. 13, 39 ordinis om. Ba; 28, 66 post diuitem add. et nobilem Ba. Besides Decl. 3, 36 domine, Ua contains the following individual readings: Decl. 13, 44 propter modicum temporale23 instead of propter modicum corruptibile; 17, 32 sic (ante if [=nec]) om. Ua; 23, 89 iudicium (ante iudicantis) instead of manum; 28, 65 homo (post hic) om. Ua . Of these discrepancies in Ua the omission of sic and homo can be explained as mechanical errors24 and iudicium instedad of manum as an anticipatory error dependent on the succeeding iudicantis.25 It is a problem whether the reading in Ua, temporale, in Decl. 13, 44, or the practically synonymous corruptibile,26 handed down un- varyingly in the other manuscripts,27 represents Prior Petrus' original text. One of these readings must be a deliberate alteration of the original reading. I have understood temporale to be a trivialization and corruptibile to be the original read- ing. Strong support for corruptibile is found in Decl. IV 125 E (med.): 0 quantus defectus caritatis est habere claues iurium in manu et propter modicum corrupti- bile28 conari contra claues et iura! Here it is seen that the same expression is used as in Decl. 13, 44. Of the separative errors in b may be noted Decl. 32, 97 Dei om. b. We may sum up as follows the problem of the mutual relations between F W Ua Mb b Gh as regards the text of Decl. in Rev. I: Mb was in all probability copied from Gh, whereas none of the other manuscripts can have been the original of any of the other younger manuscripts (including Gh) within the group. DQh1sHb The intimate relationship between D Q h 1 s Hb which could be established above (pp. 139 f., 212, 215) also reveals itself in their Decl. text, for example Decl. z8, 66 diuitem om. D Q h 1 s Hb; 32, 94 post exactor add. quidam D Qhls Hb; 32, 96 ubi] ubicumque D Q h 1 s Hb. In this group of manuscripts 1 s Hb are 22 In another version of the same Decl. F also has on fol. 268rb, line 27, indeuocionis; see above, P. 95. 23 In another version of Decl. 13 also F has, fol. 268rb, line 2, temporale; see above, p. 95. 24 Cf. Cappelli 230 (nc =nec), 337 (P-=sic), 157 (hc= hic, h° =homo). 25 Cf. Willis 92 f. 26 Cf. Mar. Victorin. in Eph. 2, 4 p. 1241 A quidquid materiale est, et temporale et corruptibile; Cassian. inst. praef. 2 temporale et corruptibile aedzficare disponens; TLL, IV, 1065, 49 f., s.v. corruptibilis. 27 Concerning F see above, n. 23. propter 28 In this place also Ua has (fol. 252', line 22) corruptibile; cf.

 221 most closely connected; this may be illustrated by the following conjunctive errors: Decl. 28, 67 quod concupiuit om. 1 s Hb; 32, 88 IV° (vel quarto)] octauo 1 s Hb. The appearance of common errors in 1 Hb, for example, Decl. 32, 90 post diabolus add. possidebat in 1 Hb2, may mean that the two manuscripts derive from the same original. In theory, it is also possible that Hb was copied from 1 or that 1 served as a corrective copy for Hb. That the original of 1 was Hb is impossible because of certain separative errors in Hb, e.g. Decl. 13, 5o istis om. Hb; 23, 88 ipsum om. Hb. In examining the Decl. of D Q h 1 s Hb nothing has been discovered to con- tradict the conclusions drawn earlier as concerns the mutual relationships of these manuscripts (see pp. 212, 215). FKLN—DQh1sHb Among other things, study of the text in Rev. I and Prol. M. showed that K N (and ql) had been dependent on the same source as D Q h 1 s Hb.29 The Decl. text in these manuscripts indicates the same dependence. However, it is also clear that the Decl. texts of Rev. I in F and L also derive from this source.3° The dependence of the manuscripts upon a common source is reflected, for in- stance, in the following common readings: Decl. 13, 40 pro eo om. F1- K L N D Q h 1 s Hb;31- 16, 58 eadem] mulier (virgo Q) fuit F32 K L D Q h 1 s Hb (and Gh) eadem mulier fuit N b eadem mulier Eb Gb om. W g deest Kb q. It is seen here that N b and Eb Gb show contaminated readings.33 Further: Decl. 16, 58 post meretrix add. que F34 KLND Qh1sHb (and Ghb); 23, 86 matris om.F35 KDQhls Hb deest L N (and Db Eb Gb Kb q); 32, 93 per verba sancti Spiritus om. F K L D Q h 1 s Hb (and Gh) deest N (Eb Gb q). F Gh On the basis of the text in Rev. I and Prol. M. a close connection could be established between F and Gh.36 The occurrence of common errors in the Decl. to Rev. I indicates that F and Gh depended upon the same source for their sup- plementary material. 29 See above, pp. 139-141, 212, 216. As for q, no certain conclusions can be drawn as this defec- tive manuscript only has Decl. 13 of Rev. I; see above, pp. 134-136. 30 See above, p. 218. Decl. 3: 8-9 was apparently lacking in this source. This section is found in F (and Ba Ir Mb b Gh) but not in L and the rest of the manuscripts; see above, pp. 218 f.; below, Pp. 225, 249. 31 This is also the case in the other version of this Decl. found in F, fol. 268'; see above, p. 95. 32 In the other version of Decl. 16, F, fol. 2671th, instead of Hec mulier fuit has only Qvedam; see above, p. 95. 33 Cf. above, pp. 119, 136 f., 212 f. 34 In the other version of the same Decl. que is missing in F, fol. 26eb. 35 In the other version of the same Decl. F also has matris, f. 268th; see above, p. 95. 36 See above, pp. 146 f.; cf. pp. 143-145. 
 
 
 
 
 222 As we have just seen, Gh has the same reading, in my opinion erroneous, as FKL(N)DQh1sHb in Decl. 16, 58 and 32, 93. That it is Gh and F that are most closely related is shown by the following common errors: Decl. 17, 31 magna om. F Gh deest L N Gb aliisque codd.;37 Decl. 17, 33 eius F Gh instead of istius; Decl. 23, 8o vero] autem F Gh. Among the manuscripts that do not have the errors common to F K L N D Q h 1 s Hb certain groups can be distinguished, united by conjunctive errors. Not unexpectedly, these groups consist of the same manuscripts which in the above study showed themselves to be most closely related;38 namely the following: MTa Cb Db Fb Instead of Declaracio in Decl. 16, 57 M Ta Cb Db .-‘13 r have De (Deinde De Cb') muliere (muliere et Diil) meretrice (meritr- Fb),39 and in Decl. 17, 25 M Ta Cb Fb have Non odire cleros (-um Ta Cb) nec (nec iter. Fb) sacerdotes deridere.39 Db lacks Decl. 17.40 In both these cases we are probably dealing with marginal notes that have been entered by mistake into the text itself in M Ta Cb. In a somewhat altered form we find the latter error in 13b, too, incorporated in the text: Nota hic non odire clerum nec deridere sacerdotes. These notes are missing in S, found to be closely related to M Ta CI) Db.41We do not know what the situation was in the defective manuscript q, also closely related to these manuscripts, since this manuscript of the Decl. in Rev. I only contains Decl. 13.42 That M Ta Cb Db reproduce a common origin, which is not Fb, would seem probable in view of such conjunctive errors as the following: Decl. 16, 6z in- quietasti (vexasti Ualj invexasti (vexasti Db) earn et M Ta Cb Db. Of these four manuscripts, M and Db and Ta and Cb, respectively, are the most closest related, as indicated, for example, by Decl. 32, 91 ante manuum add. videbatur Mi-Db videlicet Ta Da ja Pa —W g —T Ea t Study of Decl. in the a manuscripts Da ja Pa W g and in the y2 manuscripts T Ea t43 led to approximately the same result, as concerns their mutual relation- ship, as that arrived at on the basis of their text in Rev. I and Prol. M.44 The connection between W and g is very marked. Among the numerous conjunctive errors in these manuscripts may be mentioned: Decl. 13, 45 ut non debuit] eum W g; 23: 17 Apparuit mortem om. W g. Equally apparent is the relationship See above, p. 218. See above, pp. 138 f., 140-143, 213-216, 61-63. 89 In Fb these words are entered in the margin. 49 See above, p. 203. 37 38 41 42 43 44 See above, pp. 141 f., 213-216. See above, pp. 135 f., 218.

 223 between T Ea t. These manuscripts have, for example, the following common errors: Decl. 13, 5o prior om. T Ea t; 16, 64 vilissima] visibili T Ea t. That it was the corrected T ( = T2) that served as the original of Ea and t is indicated by the following fact. Originally T lacked Decl. 13. However, after the concluding word sinistrum in Rev. I 13 T1, and the closely related manuscripts i La,45 had the follow- ing reference: declaracionem require in fine sexti capituli. Before declaracionem etc. a later hand (T2) entered the reference sign A, which is also found in the lower margin of the same page, where T2 has entered the whole of Decl. 13. Probably it is this later hand that also erased capituli between declaracionem require in fine sexti and 14;, giving the number of the next chapter (14). These corrections are reflected in Ea and t in this way: the copyists of both these manuscripts have in- corporated Decl. 13 into Rev. I 13, but despite this they have copied the corrected reference in T declaracionem require in fine sexti.46 This is superfluous as the Decl. has already been entered suo loco by the scribes of Ea and t. No error common to Da ja Pa has been found in the Decl. text. Da ja lack mea in Decl. 13, 49, and Pa shows, for instance, the following individual errors: Decl. 16, 6o presentibus] videntibus Pa; 16, 61 domina sancta Birgitta aperte om. Pa. In the course of the study of the Decl. material an error has been found 45 Cf. above, pp. 84 f. has by mistake given the chapter number 14 to sexti. 46 Ea

 225 4. PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN THIS EDITION 1. Manuscripts used for the Edition As will have been apparent from my classification of the manuscripts, these are divided into two main classes or branches: (3 and Tc;' these in their turn divide up into two subgroups denoted p, and 132,2 respectively y and 8.3 For the re- construction of the 13 text I have chosen to use the f3, MSS. P V Y and the p2 MSS. B 0 Oa m; the quality of these manuscripts seemed to me to be better than that of the other 13 MSS.4 I have tried to reconstruct the Tc text using the y MSS. x y, the a MSS. F K q,5 and the editio princeps, Gh, which is to be re- garded as codicis instar. For the reconstruction of the text of the various hyp- archetypes and the archetype I have used the same method as Bergh. 8 The supple- mentary material in Rev. I, i.e. Decl. 3, 13, 16, 17, 23, z8 and 32, has been edited on the basis of the Vadstena MSS. F K' Ua and Gh. Further I have used Ba and b in the reconstruction of the Decl. 3 text and q in reconstructing the text of Decl. 13.8 z. Text and List Rubrics As will have been clear from my description of the manuscripts,9 each chapter in Rev. I is usually preceded by a rubric (text rubric).10 In certain manuscripts (e.g. in most of the y MSS.) the rubrics have been collected into a list before Prol. M. and Rev. I (list rubrics)." In many of the manuscripts there are both text and list rubrics. This, for instance, is the case in the 13, MSS. P Y Aa, in the 13 2 MSS. B 0 Oa m and in the a MSS. M N Fb q. Since the latter arrangement of the rubrics occurs in both 13 and it MSS., there is reason to assume that the rubrics were arranged in the same way in the archetype; this also seems probable for other reasons.12 The manuscripts containing list rubrics generally have these entered before Prol. M. and Rev. I. These list rubrics are in their turn preceded by a rubric, 1 See above, pp. 52 f. See above, pp. 1 48-1 99. See above, pp. 53-147. 4 The recently discovered cod. Ab has proved to be better than m; see pp. 5o f., 200 f., 211. 6 The defective cod. q (see above, pp. 134 ff.) can be supplemented in future editions with the newly discovered Fb; see above, pp. 50 f., 200,204-209. 6 See Bergh, pp. 94 ff., Bergh V, pp. 67 f. K lacks Decl. 3. 8 See above, pp. 124 f., 131 f., 134-137. 9 See above, pp. 58-61, 64-77, 94, 104, 115-126, 128-138, 148-165, 173-195, 200-210. 10 See above, p. xxxi. 11 See above, p. xxxi. In the Incipit to Rev. I most of the yl MSS. provide the following informa- tion concerning the rubrics: Rubrica istius primi capituli cum alijs habetur ante; see above, pp. 64, 68, 70, 71, 74, 77. 12 See above, pp. 16 f. 2 17 — 774372 C.-G.

 226 the text of which occurs in two versions which we may denote as A and B. Apart from minor differences in certain MSS. these texts read as follows: Rubric A: Hic est titulus huius libri, qui celestis reuelacionum Christi ad sponsam liber intitulatur, ut sequitur. Ad honorem summi Patris ... Incipit liber celestis ... Primus ... continens in se sexaginta capitula ... super que incipiunt rubrice singillatim et per ordinem ..., as found, for instance, in P.13 We also find this rubric in the X31 MSS. A and Aa (but not in Y which has the B rubric), in most of the y MSS. and in several 3 MSS.; for example in M Fb q. Rubric B: Incipiunt rubrice libri primi celestis reuelacionum Dei beate Brigide, principisse Nericie de regno Suecie diuinitus reuelati ..., as found, for instance, in B.14 The same Incipit text appears in the majority of the f32 MSS. and also in the p, Ms. Y. Even if it is most likely that the archetype of Rev. I contained both text and list rubrics—the latter probably given the rubric A above—I have not considered it necessary to include these list rubrics in the present edition. In some cases, on the other hand, for instance where in one and the same manuscript the wording of the text rubric and the list rubric are not identical, I have entered the readings from the list rubric of the manuscript in question to support my choice of reading.15 3. The Apparatuses, Orthography, etc. Apart from the apparatus criticus, the present edition provides a fairly detailed apparatus similium et testimoniorum16 which includes comments on language. In preparing these apparatuses, I have, on the whole, used the same principles as in my edition of Birger Gregerssons Birgitta-officium.17 The same is true of ortho- graphy.18 This means, for instance, that for practical reasons I have carried out certain normalizations of spelling. Thus, for example, I have used u (U) to sym- bolize the vowel u at the beginning of a word, while the consonantal u in the same position is denoted by v (V). Within a word I use u to denote both the vowel and the consonant. In normalizing the spelling, I have tried to follow the usage supported by the majority of the MSS. examined. The letters (A, B, C etc.) in the right-hand margin of the edition refer to the paragraphs into which the Gh text is divided. See p. 151; cf. Fb, p. 2o6. See p. 173. 15 See, for example, Rev. 36: R, 2 in the app. crit. In such cases I have indicated the readings of the respective MSS. in the list rubric by B* Y* etc.; see above, p. xi. The relation between the text rubrics and the list rubrics has already been treated by Bergh, pp. 89-93; cf. Bergh V, pp. 68-72; Eklund—Leby 53 f. 16 Concerning references to Turrecremata's articuli, see above, p. 3, n. 19. 17 See Undhagen 166-168. 18 See Undhagen 168-171; cf.

Non enim credendum est, quod spiritus malignus vel vere iustos decipiat, vel peccatores in melius 35 conuertat, vel caritatem, quam non habet, frigidis cordibus infundere queat, vel in aliquo gloriam Dei, cui inuidet, promoueat. 7 Sicut enim impossibile est, quod spiritus veritatis vel loquatur C mendacium, vel a iusticia quemquam auertat, vel superbiam et inuidiam cordibus sibi subditis inspiret, vel omnipotentis Dei contemptum ad- 40 ducat, sic spiritui falsitatis opposita horum malorum propter inolitam ei malignitatem et nequiciam omnino sunt interdicta. 8 Aut si quis forte hec, vel aliquid horum bonorum, spiritui maligno possibilia esse ad faciendum contendat, consequens est, ut opposita horum spiritui benigno et sancto possibilia esse concedat. Et veniet ineuitabilis error, ut 45 mala Deo et bona diabolo tribuantur et iustorum princeps et rector creda- tur diabolus, impiorum vero fautor et instigator Deus esse blasphemetur. 9 Quod si quis vere iustum discernere velit, ne per fucatam iusticiam decipiatur, sciat, quod a vere iusto relegata sunt: primum omnia vere 32 fonte omnis pietatis cfr Rev.

Et ob hoc de celo corruens, hiis tribus peccatis mundum repleuit et per ea humanum genus violauit. 34 Propter quod ego hominem assumpsi et in mundum veni, ut humilitate mea eius superbiam annichilarem, paupertate mea eius cupiditatem destruerem. 160 Et grauissimam crucis penam subii, ut eius abhominabilem concupiscen- ciam exterminarem et homini sanguine cordis mei et morte mea celum aperirem, peccatis suis preclusum, si tamen ipse velit, quantum in ipso est, ad hec operari. 35 Sed nuns homines regni Suecie, specialiter illud hominum genus, 165 quod curiale seu militare dicitur, peccant, sicut ante diabolus peccauit.

Ego sum, qui in cruce pependi et mortuus fui et sepultus, deitate illesa permanente. Quia licet ex humanitate et carne, quam ego solus Filius assumpsi, mortuus fui, tamers in deitate, in qua cum Patre et Spiritu sancto unus eram Deus, viuebam. 3 Ego idem ipse 15 sum, qui surrexi a mortuis et ascendi in celum, qui et nunc cum spiritu meo loquor tecum. Ego elegi te et assumpsi te michi in sponsam, ut ostendam tibi secreta mea, quia michi sic placet. 4 Tu eciam quodam iure facta es mea, cum in morte mariti tui volun- tatem tuam in manus meas assignasti, cum eciam eo defuncto cogitasti 20 et rogasti, quomodo pauper pro me esse posses, et voluisti omnia pro me relinquere. Et ideo de iure facta es mea. Et oportuit me pro tanta caritate tibi prouidere. Propterea assumo te michi in sponsam et in mearn propriam delectacionem, qualem Deum decet habere cum anima casta. 5 Ad sponsam ergo pertinet paratam esse, quando sponsus voluerit B 25 nupcias facere, ut sit ornata decenter et munda. Tunc bene mundaris, si cogitacio tua sit semper circa peccata tua, quomodo te in baptismo de peccato Ade mundaui, quociens in peccata lapsam te supportaui et sustinui. 6 Debet eciam sponsa habere signa sponsi sui in pectore, hoc est attendere beneficia et opera, que pro te feci, scilicet quam nobiliter te 6 sq. unus substancia cfr Stromberg, Magister Mathias' stollning 317; Ind. rer. *trinitao. personis cfr Rheinfelder, Das Wort #Persona# 159-183 (cap.

 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 5 253 datum est omne iudicium, tu iudex es eorum.>> 6 Et ille ait: »Licet omnia scitis in me et videtis, tamen propter hanc sponsam, que astat, dicite iudicium iustum!» Et illi dixerunt: »Hee est iusticia, ut, qui suffoderunt murum, puniantur ut fures, et qui in malicia persistunt, puniantur ut 20 inuasores, et qui captiui sunt, liberentur et famelici saturentur.» 7 Tunc loquebatur mater Dei, Maria, tacens in voce priori, dicens: »Domine mi et fili carissime, tu fuisti in utero meo verus Deus et homo. Tu me, que eram vas terrenum, dignacione tua sanctificasti. Supplico: miserere eis adhuc semel!» 8 Tunc respondit Dominus ad matrem: 25 »Benedictum sit verbum oris tui! Hoc quasi odor suauissimus ascendit in deitatem. Tu angelorum et omnium sanctorum gloria es et regina, quia a te deitas consolata est et omnes sancti letificati sunt. Et quia tua voluntas a principio iuuentutis tue eras sicut mea, ideo faciam adhuc semel, quod vis.» 9 Ad exercitum autem ait: »Quia vos viriliter certastis, ideo propter 3 0 caritatem vestram placabor adhuc. Ecce, ego propter preces vestras reedificabo murum meum. to Saluabo et sanabo eos, qui vi oppressi sunt, et in centuplum honorificabo illos pro contumelia, quam passi sunt. Violentis autem, si misericordiam pecierint, pacem et misericordiam dabo. Qui autem contempserint, iusticiam meam sencient.>> 35 II Deinde ait ad sponsam: »Sponsa mea, ego elegi te et induxi te in spiritum meum.

Castrum c 4 0 illud, quod supra dixi, est ipsa sancta Ecclesia, quam de sanguine meo et sanctorum meorurn edificaui et cemento caritatis mee coniunxi, et posui in ea electos meos et amicos. r3 Fundamentum huius est fides, scilicet credere me iustum iudicem et misericordem. Sed nuns suffossum est fundamentum, quia omnes credunt me et predicant misericordem, sed 45 quasi nullus predicat nec credit me esse iuste iudicantem. 14 Ipsi habent me quasi iniquum iudicem. Iniquus enim esset iudex, qui ex misericordia dimitteret iniquos impunitos, ut iniqui iustos eo magis opprimerent. Sed ego sum iustus iudex et misericors, ita quod nec minimum peccatum relinquam impunitum nec minimum bonum irremuneratum. /5 Per 5 0 huius muri suffossionem intrauerunt illi in Ecclesiam sanctam, qui absque timore peccant, qui me iustum esse negant et amicos meos sic conturbant, quemadmodum illos, qui sunt in cippo. Non enim est eis- dem amicis meis gaudium nec consolacio, sed omne obprobrium et omnis dolor eis imponitur tamquam demoniacis. /6 Si veritatem de me dixerint, confutantur et mendacii arguuntur. 55 Vehementer siciunt audire vel loqui recta, sed non est, qui eos audiat vel eis recta loquatur. 17 Ego quoque, Deus et creator, blasphemor. Dicunt enim: 'Nescimus, si est Deus. Et si est, non curamus.' Vexillum meum prosternitur et conculcatur, dicentes: 'Quare passus est?

Capitulum VI. >Inimici mei sunt quasi bestie ferocissime: numquam saciari possunt 5 nec requiescere. Horum cor sic est vacuum a caritate mea, quod num- quam in eo intrat cogitacio passionis mee. Numquam semel adhuc pro- cessit de intimo corde eorum hoc verbum: 'Domine, redemisti nos, Taus sit tibi pro amara passione tua!' Quomodo spiritus meus potest esse cum eis, qui nullam diuinam caritatem habent ad me, qui, ut voluntatem .0 suam perficiant, libenter produnt alios? Ipsorum cor plenum est ver- mibus vilissimis, idest affeccionibus mundi. In ore eorum posuit dia- bolus stercus suum, et ideo non placent eis verba mea. Ideo ego separabo eos ab amicis meis cum seca mea. Et sicut non est mors ulla morte sece amarior, sic non est supplicium, quo non participes fiant, et secabuntur .5 per medium a diabolo et diuidentur a me. Sic sunt odiosi michi, quod eciam omnes, qui adherent eis, separabuntur a me. 3 Ideo mitto amicos meos, ut diuidant diabolos a membris meis, quia ipsi vere sunt inimici mei.

 258 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 7 filium Dei. Ego sum regina angelorum. Filius meus diligit te toto corde. Ideo dilige tu eum! Tu debes esse ornata honestissimis vestibus. Que quomodo et quales debeant esse, monstrabo tibi. z Sicut enim tu prius habuisti camisiam, inde tunicam, calceos, pallium et monile in pectore, sic nunc spiritualiter habere debes. Camisia est contricio. Sicut enim 10 camisia propinquior est carpi, sic contricio et confessio prima via est conuersionis ad Deum. Qua mens, que gaudebat in peccato, mundatur et caro sordida refrenatur. 3 Calcei duo sunt duo affectus, voluntas scilicet emendandi commissa et voluntas faciendi bona et abstinendi a malis. Tunica tua est spes ad Deum, quia sicut tunica habet duas manicas, sic 1 5 in spe sit iusticia et misericordia, ut sic speres de misericordia Dei, quod non negligas iusticiam eius. Et sic cogita iusticiam eius et iudicium, ut non obliuiscaris misericordiam, quia nec iusticiam aliquam facit sine misericordia nec misericordiam sine iusticia. 4 Pallium est fides. Sicut enim pallium omnia operit et omnia in eo concluduntur, sic fide homo omnia potest comprehendere et attingere. 20 Hoc pallium debet esse respersum signis caritatis sponsi tui, quomodo scilicet creauit te, quomodo redemit te, quomodo enutriuit te et induxit te in spiritum suum et aperuit tibi oculos spirituales. 5 Monile est con- sideracio passionis eius. Hoc sit iugiter fixum in pectore tuo, quomodo 25 derisus et flagellatus, quomodo sanguinolentus et omnibus neruis con- fossis viuus stabat in cruce, quomodo in morte ex passione doloris acutissimi totum corpus contremuit, quomodo in manus patris com- mendabat spiritum.

Tamen pro certo dico tibi, B quod ex caritate diuina et ex verbo angeli annunciantis conuenerunt 20 carne, non ex concupiscencia aliqua voluptatis sed contra voluntatem suam ex diuina dileccione, et sic ex semine eorum per diuinam caritatem caro mea compaginata est. 4 Facto autem corpore meo Deus a diuinitate sua animam creatam immisit corpori, et mox anima cum corpore sancti- ficata est, quam angeli custodiebant et seruabant die ac nocte. Cum 25 autem anima sanctificaretur et corpori coniungeretur, tanta matri mee aduenit leticia, ut impossibile esset dictu. Deinde completo cursu vite mee, primo animam meam, quia ipsa domina erat corporis, ad deitatem excellencies ceteris eleuauit, inde corpus meum, ut nullius creature corpus sit tam propinquum Deo sicut meum. g Ecce quantum filius 3 0 meus dilexit animam meam et corpus!

Instante vero tempore, quo secundum constitucionem virgines B 25 presentabantur in templo Domini, affui et ego inter eas propter obe- dienciam parentum meorum, cogitans mecum Deo nichil esse impossi- bile. Et quia ipse sciebat me nichil desiderare, nichil velle nisi se, posset me seruare in virginitate, si ei placeret; sin autem, fieret voluntas eius. 6 Auditis autem omnibus, que mandata erant in templo, regressa domum 3o ampliori quam prius ardebam amore Dei et nouis cotidie inflammabar estibus et desideriis amoris. Propterea plus solito ab omnibus me elongaui et fui sola noctibus ac diebus, timens vehementissime, ne os loqueretur vel auris audiret aliqua contra Deum meum, vel ne oculi mei viderent aliqua delectabilia. Timida quoque fui in silencio et multum anxia, ne 35 forte silerem ea, que magis loqui debuissem. Cumque sic turbarer in corde sola mecum spemque omnem meam committerem Deo, illico venit in mentem meam cogitare Dei magnam potenciam, quomodo ei seruiunt angeli et omnia creata, qualis gloria eius est, que est ineffabilis et interminabilis. 8 Et cum hec mirarer, vidi 40 tria mirabilia. Vidi namque sydus, sed non quale fulget de celo. Vidi lumen, C sed non quale lucet in mundo.

 268 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. IO 22 Stante autem filio meo, sicut natus erat, nudo corpore, unus tune accurrens apportauit sibi velamen, quo ipse exultans intime velabat IIO verecundiora sua. Postea rapuerunt eum seui tortores et extenderunt in cruce, primo dexteram manum eius affigentes stipiti, qui pro clauis perforatus erat. Et manum ipsam ex ea parte perforabant, qua os solidius erat. Inde trahentes cum fune aliam manum eius, ad stipitem earn simili modo affixerunt. z3 Deinde dexterum pedem crucifixerunt et super hunc 11 5 sinistrum duobus clauis ita, ut omnes nerui et vene extenderentur et rumperentur. Quo facto aptauerunt coronam de spinis capiti eius, que tam vehementer reuerendum caput filii mei pupugit, ut ex sanguine fluente replerentur oculi eius, obstruerentur aures et Barba tota decur- rente sanguine deturparetur. Cumque sic sanguinolentus et perforatus 120 staret, condolens michi astanti et gementi, respexit sanguinolentis oculis ad Iohannem, sororium meum, et me commendabat ei. 24 In tempore illo audiui alios dicentes, quod filius meus latro erat, alios, quia mendax, alios, quod nullus dignior esset morte quam filius meus. Ex quorum auditu dolor meus renouabatur. Sed, sicut dictum 125 est, cum primus clauus infigeretur ei, ego ad primum ictum conturbata cecidi quasi mortua, oculis obscuratis, manibus trementibus, pedibus nutantibus. Et non respexi pre amaritudine, antequam ex toto affixus erat. 25 Surgens vero vidi filium meum miserabiliter pendentem, et ego, mater eius mestissima, undique consternata, pre dolore vix stare potui. 1 3 0 Filius autem meus, videns me et amicos suos inconsolabiliter flentes, §§ 22 sq. cfr Rev.

Manus et pedes eius rigidissime extenti erant et iuxta formam crucis cruci attracti et conformati. Barba et crines ex toto respersi sanguine. 27 Itaque cum filius meus sic laceratus et liuidus staret, solum cor recens 140 erat, quia optime et fortissime nature erat. De mea enim carne corpus mundissimum et optime complexionatum sumpsit. 28 Cutis eius sic tenera et gracilis erat, quod numquam sic leuiter flagellabatur, quin statim exiret sanguis. Ipse quoque sanguis eius tam recens erat, ut in cute munda videri posset. Et quia optime nature erat, vita cum morte in 145 corpore eius perforato certabat. 29 Nam quandoque dolor de membris et neruis corporis perforatis ad cor ascendebat, quod recentissimum erat et incorruptum, et incredibili dolore et passione vexabat ipsum. Et quandoque dolor a corde in membra lacerata descendebat et sic mortem prolongabat cum amaritudine. 150 30 Cumque filius meus hiis doloribus circumseptus respexisset ad I amicos suos flentes, qui maluissent illam penam in se cum auxilio eius pertulisse vel in eternum in inferno ardere quam eum sic videre cruciari, sq.; Matth. 27, 46, Marc. 15, 34. vita ... certabat cfr Rev.

Et quociens postea hanc vocem cogitabam, quasi in aure mea presens et 16o recens erat. Appropinquante autem morte, cum cor pre violencia dolo- rum rumperetur, tunc omnia membra contremuerunt et caput eius quasi modicum se erigens inclinabatur, os eius apertum videbatur et lingua tota sanguinolenta. 32 Manus eius retraxerunt se modicum de loco per- foracionis et pondus corporis pedes amplius sustentabant. Digiti et 165 brachia quodammodo extendebant se et dorsum fortiter stringebatur ad stipitem. 33 Tunc quidam dixerunt ad me: 'Maria, filius tuus mortuus est.' Alii autem dixerunt: 'Mortuus est sed resurget.' Omnibus itaque discedenti- bus, unus adueniens affixit lanceam in latus eius tam valide, ut pene per i70 aliud latus eius transiret. Et cum extraheretur hasta, apparuit cuspis rubea sanguine. Tunc michi videbatur, quod quasi cor meum perforare- tur, cum vidissem cor filii mei carissimi perforatum. 34 Deinde depositus est de cruce.

Inde completa seu repleta naue ventris concupiscencia, effluebat aqua et operiebat nauem voluptate, ne veniret ad portum salutis. 3 Secundus demon, qui sedet in corde, est similis vermi iacenti in pomo, qui nucleum pomi primo comedit, inde, relictis ibi stercoribus suis, peruagatur totum pomum, donec totum feet inane.

Multi quippe orant non recta intencione, et ideo non exaudiri merentur. 3 Tria namque sunt genera hominum seruiencium michi in hoc mundo. Primi sunt, qui me credunt esse Deum et largitorem omnium et super omnia potentem. Hii seruiunt michi hac intencione, ut scilicet 1 5 temporalia et honorem optineant, sed celestia sunt eis pro nichilo et gaudenter ea amittunt, ut optineant presencia.

Et sic amissis eternis, in temporali commoditate remunero eos, quidquid boni fecerint pro me, usque ad ultimum quadrantem et usque ad nouissimum punctum. 4 20 Secundi sunt, qui credunt me Deum omnipotentem et districtum iudi- B cem, et isti seruiunt michi ex timore pene, non autem ex amore celestis glorie. Nisi enim timerent, non michi seruirent. g Tercii sunt, qui cre- dunt me omnium creatorem et verum Deum, qui credunt me iustum et misericordem. Et seruiunt michi non ex timore alicuius pene sed ex 25 diuina dileccione et caritate. Et mallent quippe omnem penam, si suffice- rent, magis ferre quam me semel ad iram prouocare.

Capitulum XV. Ego sum sicut unus rex magnus et potens. Ad regem enim perti- nent quatuor: primo debet esse diues, secundo mites, tercio sapiens, quarto caritatiuus. Ego vere sum rex angelorum et omnium hominum. Ego eciam habeo illas quatuor proprietates, quas dixi. 2, Primo namque sum ditissimus, quia omnibus do necessaria, nec minus habeo post datum. Secundo sum mitissimus, quia omnibus petentibus paratus sum io dare. Tercio itaque sum sapientissimus, quia scio, quid unicuique debe- tur et expedit. Quarto eciam sum caritatiuus, quia paracior sum dare quam aliquis petere. 3 Ego habeo quasi duo gazophilacia. In primo enim gazophilacio sunt reposita ponderosa et grauia quasi plumbum, et cella ista, ubi ista sunt, 15 est circumsepta acutis aculeis pungentibus. Sed qui hec primo incipit vertere et reuoluere et deinde portare didicerit, leuia videntur sibi postea quasi pluma. Et sic leuissima fiunt, que antea ponderosa videbantur, et suauia, que prius pungere credebantur. 4 In secundo gazophilacio vide- tur esse aurum resplendens et lapides preciosi et pocula odorifera et 20 dulcia. Sed vere aurum illud est luteum et illa pocula sunt venenum. Ad hec namque gazophilacia sunt due vie, sed ante erat unica via.

Si autem non audieritis nec videritis, saltem attrectate manibus, et probabitis, quod in verbis meis nulla est falsitas.' 6 Tunc ait primus illorum: 'Audiamus et videamus, si verba eius vera sunt.' Secundus homo ait: 'Falsum est, quidquid dicit.' Tercius dixit: 'Scio, quod vera sunt, que dicit, sed non curo.' 3o 7 Quid sunt ista duo gazophilacia nisi amor meus et amor mundi? Sed ad hec duo gazophilacia sunt due vie: abieccio et perfecta abnegacio proprie voluntatis, que ducit ad amorem meum, et carnis voluptas, que ducit ad amorem mundi. 8 In amore autem meo videtur aliquibus esse onus quasi plumbum, quia, cum ieiunare debent et vigilare seu refrenare 35 carnem, quasi plumbum portare sibi videntur. Si autem verba et con- tumelias audierint, si in religione et oracione morantur, quasi inter aculeos resident et in omni hora angustiantur. 9 Sed qui in amore meo c esse vult, incipiat primo vertere onus, idest conetur ad faciendum bona per voluntatem et continuum desiderium. Inde leuet modice et paula- 4 0 tim, idest faciat ea, que potest, cogitando sic: 'Hoc bene possum facere, si Deus dederit michi auxilium.' 10 Deinde perseuerans in incepto cum tanta alacritate ea, que videbantur sibi prius esse onerosa, incipit por- tare, quod omnis labor in ieiuniis seu vigiliis et aliis laboribus quibus- cumque est sibi tam leuis quasi pluma. Et in tali sede quiescunt amici 45 mei, que est malis et desidiosis quasi circumsepta aculeis et spinis, sed amicis meis est summa quies et lenis quasi rosa. 11 Ad hoc gazophila- cium est via recta contemptus proprie voluntatis, quando homo, con- siderata passione et caritate mea, non curat facere voluntatem suam et resistit totis viribus et conatur semper ad maiora. 12 Et licet ista via in § 6 cfr §§ 21-26. 38 conetur fere = (at)tendat, (an)nitatur (cfr TLL IV 349, 4 6-49; H—Sz 378 (9). §§ 9 sq. cfr §,sc 27 sq. § 1 o sibi =ei. 46 lenis quasi rosa (Lundell I 96 perperam »lent som dagg» [Lat.

Omnis enim, qui portat aurum, contingit ei, quod, cum debilitatur eius corpus et deficiunt membra et cum eius annichilatur medulla et corpus ipsius cadit per mortem in terram, tunc relinquit aurum et lapides et non valent sibi plus quam lutum. 14 Pocula eciam mundi, idest delectaciones, videntur delectabilia, sed cum veniunt in 6o ventrem, debilitant caput, grauant cor et omnia membra euertunt, et postea quasi fenum homo arescit. Et appropinquante dolore mortis omnia delectabilia fiunt amara quasi venenum. is Ad hoc gazophilacium ducit propria voluntas, quando homo non curat resistere affeccionibus suis prauis neque meditatur, que ego precepi et feci, sed, quidquid venit 65 in eius cogitacionem, siue licitum siue illicitum, hoc statim facit. 16 Per hanc viam tres viri ambulant, in quibus intelligo omnes re- E probos, qui diligunt mundum et omnem voluntatem propriam. Hiis ego clamaui, qui stabam in competis seu in ingressu viarum, quia veniens in carne humana ostendi hominibus quasi duas vias, scilicet quid sequen- 7 0 dum esset quidue fugiendum, que via scilicet ducebat ad vitam et que ad mortem. Nam ante aduentum meum in carne non erat nisi una via, qua omnes boni et mali ibant in infernum. 17 Ego autem sum ille, qui clama- bat, et clamabam sic: '0 homines, audite verba mea, que ducunt ad viam So 58 Pocula vide v. 19. 58 sibi =ei. 54 Pocula vide v. 19. arescit cfr Rev.

Et si non auditis ea vel non potestis audire, saltem videte, scilicet fide et intellectu, quia vera sunt verba mea. Sicut enim oculis carnis cernitur visibile aliquid, sic oculis fidei cerni possunt inuisibilia et credi. /8 Multi denique sunt simplices in Ecclesia, qui pauca bona operantur, per fidem tamen saluantur, qua credunt me creatorem omnium et re- 8o demptorem. Nullus quippe est, qui me non possit intelligere esse Deum et credere, si considerat, quomodo terra fructificat et quomodo celum dat pluuias, quomodo arbores virent, quomodo animalia unumquodque in genere suo subsistunt, quomodo sydera homini seruiunt, quomodo contraria eueniunt voluntati hominis. 85 19 Ex hiis omnibus potest homo videre, quod mortalis est et quod Deus est ille, qui omnia ista disponit. Si enim non esset Deus, omnia ista irent inordinate. Ergo omnia sunt a Deo et omnia racionabiliter propter edificacionem hominis sunt disposita. Nec minimum est in mundo, quod sine racione sit vel subsistat. Ergo si homo non potest propter infirmita- 9 0 tem virtutem meam, sicut est, capere vel intelligere, potest tamen videre per fidem et credere. zo Si autem, o homines, nolueritis considerare intellectu potenciam meam, potestis tamen attrectare manibus vestris opera, que ego feci et sancti mei. Quia sic aperta sunt, quod nullus dubi- tare potest esse opera Dei. zr Quis suscitauit mortuos et illuminauit 95 cecos nisi Deus? Quis expulit demones nisi Deus?

Cum autem vocati fuerint, quern magis dominum dilexerint, ab eo remunerabuntur. Secundus homo dicit, idest aliqui: 'Falsum est, quidquid loquitur, et falsa est Scriptura.' Ego sum Deus et creator omnium, et sine me nichil 10 5 factum est. Ego condidi nouam legem et veterem et de ore meo processit, nec in ea est aliqua falsitas, quia ego sum veritas. Ergo qui me falsum dixisse dicunt et Scripturam sacram falsam dicunt, ipsi numquam vide- bunt faciem meam, quia consciencia eorum dicit eis me esse Deum, quia omnia fiunt secundum voluntatem meam et disposicionem meam. 24 0 Celum illuminat eos nec ipsi se illuminare possunt, terra fructum gignit, aer fecundat terram, omnia animalia habent certam disposicionem, demones confitentur me, iusti homines paciuntur incredibilia propter amorem meum. Hec omnia vident nec tamers vident me. 25 Ipsi eciam possunt videre me in iusticia mea, si considerarent, quomodo terra 115 absorbuit impios, ignis combussit iniquos. Sic eciam possunt videre me in misericordia mea, quando aqua de petra fluxit iustis et aqua maris cedebat eis, quando ignis non ledebat eos, quando celum quasi terra nutriebat eos.

Postea decepi eam tribus viciis, scilicet gula, cupiditate pecunie et luxuria. 3 Ideo ego sedeo nunc in ventre eius et in 5 natura eius. Et teneo eam quinque manibus.

 290 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 18 appareat, nisi quod humilitatem redoleat. Quia illi, qui michi nunc domos edificant, ipsi sunt similes magistris edificantibus. Ad quos cum dominus edificii ingreditur, recipiunt eum per crines et terunt eum sub pedibus, lutum ponunt in sublimi et aurum sub pedibus. Sic faciunt ipsi 15 michi. 3 Edificant enim lutum, idest temporalia ista casura ponunt quasi ad celum. Animas autem, que sunt preciosiores auro, minime curant. Si ego ingredi volo ad eos per predicatores meos aut per cogitaciones bonas, ipsi arripiunt me per crines et conculcant me sub pedibus, idest blasphemiam michi inferunt et opera mea et verba mea contemptibilia 20 reputant quasi lutum. Se autem estimant multo sapienciores. Si enim michi edificare vellent ad honorem meum, animas primo edificarent. 4 Quicumque autem domum meam edificat, summo studio apponat B curam, ut non veniat ibi ad edificium unus denarius, qui non sit bene et iuste acquisitus. Multi quippe sunt, qui se male acquisita bona habere 25 sciunt, et tamen de hoc non dolent nec voluntatem habent restituendi et satisfaciendi ipsis defraudatis et spoliatis, quamuis possent restituere et satisfacere, si vellent. Sed tamen, quia cogitant secum in eternum non posse possidere ea, dant partem ecclesiis ex illis bonis iniuste acquisitis, quasi per hanc donacionem placatum me habeant.

Sic tu, mater, a iuuentute didicisti sequi voluntatem meam et relinquere omnem voluntatem tuam pro me. Ideo bene dixisti: 'Fiat v olunt as tua!'3Tu enim es quasi aurum .0 preciosum, quod extenditur et percutitur super durum incudem, quia tu omnibus tribulacionibus percuciebaris et in passione mea pre ceteris paciebaris, quia, quando cor meum in cruce pre vehemencia doloris rumpebatur, tuum cor ex hoc quasi ferro acutissimo vulnerabatur, et libenter scindi permisisses, si fuisset voluntas mea. 4 Verumptamen 1 5 eciam si potuisses restitisse passions mee et optasse vitam meam, tu tamen noluisti nisi iuxta voluntatem meam.

Primo debes esse parata ad nupcias deita- tis mee, in quibus nulla est libido carnalis sed spiritualis delectacio suauis- sima, qualem decet Deum habere cum anima casta, ita ut non filiorum amor tuorum, non eciam bonorum vel parentum, retrahat to ab amore 3o meo. Ne contingat tibi sicut illis virginibus fatuis, que imparate erant, quando Dominus voluit vocare eas ad nupcias, et ideo excludebantur. Secundo debes esse credula verbis meis. Ego enim sum verit as et de ore meo numquam nisi veritas procedit, nec aliquis potest inuenire in verbis meis nisi veritatem. Quia quandoque spiritualiter intelligo, que 35 loquor, quandoque sicut tunc ipsa littera sonat, et ipsa verba mea tune nude debent intelligi, et ideo nullus potest me arguere de mendacio. Tercio debes esse obediens, ut nullum sit membrum, in quo deliquisti, c de quo non exigas dignam penitenciam et emendacionem. Quia licet sim misericors, tamen iusticiam non relinquo. Ideo, quibus teneris, obedias 4 0 humiliter et hilariter, ita ut eciam, quod tibi videtur utile et racionabile, contra obedienciam non facias.

Et dato illi mago auro meliori et maioris quantitatis, 10 recepit ab eo aurum splendidum et posuit in scrinio, cogitans facere sibi inde anulum super digitum suum. 3 Modico autem interiecto tempore venit magus ad hominem ilium simplicem dicens: 'Aurum hoc, quod emisti et posuisti in scrinio tuo, non est aurum, ut putas, sed vilissima rana, que nutrita est in pectore 1 5 meo et alita cibo meo. Et ut hec probes esse vera, aperi scrinium, et vide- bis, quod rana insiliet in pectus meum, de quo nutrita est.' 4 Cumque ille aperire vellet et experiri, apparuit rana in scrinio, cuius operculum pen- debat super quatuor cardines, quasi cicius casuros.

Nam falsa promittit esse vera et vera 30 facit videri falsa. Ipse enim possidet aurum illud preciosurn, idest ani- mam, quam preciosiorem omnibus stellis et planetis per potenciam deita- tis mee feci, quam immortalem et stabilem et delectabiliorem michi ceteris creaui, et preparaui ei mecum eternarn requiem et habitacionem. Hanc ego de potestate diaboli meliori auro et maioris precii emi, C 35 quando pro ea dedi carnem meam, immunem ab omni peccato, et susti- nui tarn amaram passionem, quod nullum mernbrum meum esset sine vulnere. Redempta autem anima, posui earn in corpore tamquam in scrinio, donee earn in dignitate deitatis mee collocarem. 8 Nunc autem anima hominis sic redempta facta est velut turpissirna 40 et vilissirna rana, saltans per superbiam et commorans in ceno per luxu- riam, et abstulit michi aurum, idest omnem iusticiam meam. Et ideo diabolus bene potest dicere michi: 'Aurum, quod emisti, non est aurum, sed rana, nutrita in pectore delectacionis mee. Separa ergo corpus ab anima, et videbis, quod statim volabit ad pectus mee delectacionis, ubi 45 nutrita est.' 9 Cui ego respondeo: 'Quia rana horrida est visu, horribilis voce et venenosa in tactu nec aliquid michi Boni nec delectacionis con- fert, sed tibi, in cuius pectore nutrita est, tua propria sit, quia tua de iure est.

Ad cuius scrinium, idest corpus, nunc per appropinquacionem mortis appropinquo, quod pendet in quatuor cardinibus casuris, quia corpus eius ex quatuor subsistit, scilicet fortitudine, pulchritutine, sa- piencia et visu, que omnia iam nunc incipiunt sibi deficere. rr Cumque 55 anima eius separabitur a corpore, statim volabit ad diabolum, de cuius lacte nutrita est, quia oblita est dileccionis mee, qua supplicium eius, quod meruerat, pro ea suscepi. Nam michi non rependit dileccionem pro dileccione mea sed insuper aufert michi iusticiam meam, quia michi 6o magis deberet seruire, qui redemi earn, quam alteri.

Tercio cogita, quanta gloria est anime, que cum Deo et in Deo sine fine viuit. 4 Contra secundum, scilicet quod inimici Dei sunt multi, do eciam B tibi tria remedia. Primo considera, quod Deus tuus et creator tuus et 20 eorum est iudex super eos, et numquam amplius ipsi iudicabunt eum, licet pacienter supportet ad tempus maliciam eorum. Secundo, quod filii dampnacionis sunt et quam graue et intolerabile erit eis semper ardere. 5 Ipsi sunt serui pessimi, qui carebunt hereditate, filii autem recipient hereditatem. Sed dices forte: 'Ergo non est eis predicandum?' Utique! 25 Considera, quod inter malos frequenter sunt Boni. Et filii adoptiui quan- doque recedunt a bono, sicut ille filius prodigus, qui abiit in aliam regio- nem longinquam et vixit male. 6 Sed ipsi quandoque per predicacionem compuncti reuertuntur ad patrem et erunt eo accepciores, quo prius peccatores. Ideo eis magis predicandum est, quia, licet predicator fere 3 0 omnes videat malos, consideret tamen secum: 'Forte sunt aliqui inter eos filii futuri Domini mei. Predicabo ergo eis.'

Et quidquid diabolus sugges- 55 sit eis ad malum, hoc ego totum conuerti eis in bonum. 12 Deinde ostendi eis modum viuendi et colendi me et permisi eis licite commisceri, cum tamen ante permissionem meam et indicacionem timore percussi formidabant coniungi. Similiter et occiso Abel cum multo tempore lugerent et abstinerent, ego compassione permotus conso- 6o latus sum eos.

Capitulum XXIX. Mater Dei loquitur ad sponsam filii dicens: #Due sunt domine. Una 5 est, que non habet nomen speciale, quia indigna est nomine; alia est Humilitas, que vocatur Maria. Super primam est dominus ipse diabolus, quia sibi dominatur. 2 Huic domine dicebat miles suus: '0 domina, quidquid possum, facere pro te paratus sum, tantum ut fruar semel con- cubitu tuo. Nam ego sum fortis viribus, magnanimus corde, nichil timeo, io et paratus sum ire in mortem pro te.' Cui illa respondit: 'Serue meus, magna est caritas tua. Sed ego sedeo in sublimi sede nec habeo nisi unam sedem, et inter nos sunt tres porte. 3 Prima porta est sic arta, ut, quid- quid homo habuerit in corpore, si ingreditur per eam, omnia dirumpun- tur et abstrahuntur. Secunda est sic acuta, quod pungit usque ad neruos. 15 Tercia porta est sic ardens, quod nulla est requies ardoris, sed qui ingreditur per eam, statim liquescet sicut es. 4 Ego autem sedeo subli- miter et qui sedere vult mecum, cum non habeam nisi unam sedem, cadet ad chaos maximum subtus me.'

 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 29 325 Domina ista est Superbia, ad quam qui peruenire voluerit, ingredie- tur quasi per tres portas. Primam portam ingreditur, qui totum dat ad laudem hominum et pro superbia. Et si nichil habet, adhibet totam vo- luntatem suam, quomodo superbire et laudari possit. Secundam portam ingreditur ille, qui, quidquid laborat et quidquid facit, et totum tempus 25 et cogitaciones et omnes vires suas dat ad hoc, ut superbiam perficiat. 6 Et si eciam posset carnem suam lacerandam tradere causa honoris et diuiciarum, libenter faceret. Terciam portam ingreditur, qui numquam requiescit et numquam silet et totus quasi ignis ardet, quomodo perue- niat ad aliquem honorem vel mundi superbiam. Sed cum optinuerit, 3 0 quod cupit, non potest diu in eodem statu manere sed cadet miserabiliter. Nichilominus tamen superbia remanet in mundo. 7 Ego auterm, ait Maria, >>que humillima sum, sedeo in sede spaciosa et supra me non est sol nec luna nec stelle nec eciam nubes sed mira et inestimabilis claritatis serenitas, procedens a pulchritudine preclare 35 maiestatis diuine. Infra me eciam non est terra vel Lapides sed requies C incomparabilis in virtute Dei. Iuxta me non est murus seu paries sed angelorum et sanctarum animarum gloriosus exercitus. 8 Et quamuis sic sublimiter sedeo, tamen audio amicos meos, in terra existentes, michi cotidie gemitus fundentes et lacrimas. Video labores eorum et efficaciam 40 eorum maiorem quam illorum, qui pugnant pro sua domina superbia.

 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 30 327 2 Iudei fecerunt michi tria genera penarum in passione mea: primo io lignum, quo affixus sum et flagellatus et coronatus; secundo ferrum, quo affixerunt manus meas et pedes; tercio potum fellis, quo potauerunt me. Deinde blasphemabant me fatuum esse propter mortem, quam libenter sustinebam, et vocabant me mendacem propter doctrinam meam. 3 Tales nunc in mundo multiplicati sunt et pauci faciunt michi consola- .5 cionem. Nam affigunt me ligno per voluntatem peccandi, flagellant me per impacienciam, quia unum verbum pro me nullus ferre potest. Et coronant me spina superbie sue, qua alciores me esse volunt. Pungunt manus meas et pedes ferro induracionis, quia gloriantur de peccato et indurant se, ne timeant me. 20 4 Pro felle offerunt michi tribulacionem, pro passione, ad quam letus iui, dicunt me mendacem et fatuum. Ego enim potens sum submergere eos et totum mundum propter peccata sua, si vellem. Et tunc, si sub- mergerem eos, illi, qui remanerent, seruirent michi ex timore, sed hoc non esset iusticia, quia ex caritate deberet michi homo seruire. 5 Si 25 autem personaliter venirem inter eos visibilis, oculi eorum non sustine- rent videre me nec aures audire me.

Ego sum Dominus super mortem et vitam. Ego idem volo habitare in corde tuo. Ecce, quantam 35 caritatem habeo ad te! 8 Celi et terra et omnia, que in eis sunt, non pos- sunt capere me et tamen in corde tuo, quod non est nisi modicum frustum carnis, habitare volo.

 LIBRI PRIM! CAP. 31 329 Qualiter sponsa videbat dukissimam virginem Mariam corona et aliis orna- mentis inestimabiliter decoratam et quomodo sponse sanctus Iohannes Bap- tista, quid per coronam etcetera designetur, declarat. Capitulum XXXI. Videbat sponsa reginam celi, matrem Dei, habentem preciosam co- 5 ronam inestimabilem in capite suo et capillos extensos super spatulas admirabilis pulchritudinis, tunicam auream splendore indicibili corus- cantem et mantellum de azuro seu sereni celi coloris. Z Cumque de tam speciosa visione vehementer admiraretur sponsa et in tali admiracione tota staret quodam interno stupore suspensa, illico apparuit ei beatus 3 Audi diligenter, quid hoc notat! Corona 10 Iohannes Baptista, qui ait igitur notat, quod regina et domina est et mater regis angelorum. Capilli protensi, quod virgo est purissima et immaculata. Mantellum celi coloris, quod omnia temporalia erant ei quasi mortua.

Primus lapis est virtuositas singularis, quia non est aliqua virtus in aliquo spiritu siue in corpore aliquo, qua ipsa hanc eandem virtutem non habeat excellencius. 6 Secundus lapis est perfectissima mundicia, 25 quia ista regina cell sic pura fuit, quod una macula peccati inueniri num- quam potuit in ea a principio ingressus eius in mundum usque ad ulti- mam diem mortis ipsius. Nec omnes diaboli tantam impuritatem reperire poterant in ea, ubi cuspis acus poni posset. Ipsa vere erat purissima. Nam non decuit regem glorie iacere nisi in vase purissimo et mundissimo et 3 0 electissimo pre omnibus angelis et hominibus. Tercius lapis fuit pulchritudo eius, quia Deus de pulchritudine eiusdem matris sue iugiter laudatur a sanctis suis et gaudium sanctorum angelorum et omnium sanctarum animarum impletur ex pulchritudine eius. 8 Quartus lapis preciosus corone est sapiencia eiusdem virginis 35 matris, quia ipsa impleta est omni diuina sapiencia cum Deo et ex ea omnis impletur et perficitur sapiencia. 9 Quintus lapis est fortitudo, quia c ipsa sic est fortis cum Deo, quod omnia, quecumque creata et facta sunt, potest deprimere. ro Sextus eciam lapis est claritas eius, que sic clara est, quod angeli, qui habent oculos clariores luce, illuminantur ex ea et 4 0 demones non audent respicere in claritatem eius.

Numquid non tunc est in anima, cum est in consciencia?' Nequaquam.

Sed forte to potes querere: 'Quomodo crucifigunt eum?' Utique, primo ponunt eum in cruce, quam sibi preparauerant, quando de precep- tis creatoris sui et Domini non curant, et dehonestant eum, quando ipse 3 0 monet eos per seruos suos seruire sibi, et ipsi hoc contempnentes faciunt, que sibi placent. 8 Deinde crucifigunt dexteram manum, quando tenent iusticiam pro iniusticia, dicentes: 'Peccatum non est sic graue et odiosum Deo, sicut dicitur, nec Deus in eternum affligit quemquam sed propter timorem minatus est. Quare enim redimeret hominem, si vellet eum 35 perire?', non attendentes, quod minimum peccatum, si homo delectatur in eo, satis est ei ad supplicium eternum. 9 Et quia non minimum pecca- tum dimittit Deus impunitum, sicut non minimum bonum sine remu- neracione, ideo sempiternum erit eis supplicium, quia sempiternam habent voluntatem peccandi, quam filius meus, qui videt cor, reputat pro 40 opere.

Et si sunt, qui loquuntur, con- tempnuntur et mendacii arguuntur. 8 Ideo verba mea, que de ore meo procedunt, vestire debent hanc fidem quasi lana.

Tercio caritatem, quando dicebam 'Fiat voluntas tua!' 2 Ego eciam habui angustias corporis ex timore naturali passionis, quando sudor sanguinis exiuit de corpore. Ideo, ne amici mei trepidarent se relictos, cum instat eis tribulacio, ego ostendi eis in me, quod caro .0 infirma semper refugit molestias. 3 Sed potes querere, quomodo sudor sanguinis exiuit de corpore meo. Utique, sicut sanguis infirmi in omnibus venis siccatur et consumitur in venis, sic ex dolore naturali mortis sanguis meus consumebatur. 4 Pater denique volens ostendere viam, per quam aperiretur celum et B .5 homo exclusus ingrederetur, tradidit me ex caritate in passionem, ut corpus meum consumata passione glorificaretur in gloria. Non enim sine passione humanitas mea in gloriam venire posset ex iusticia, licet potuis- sem ex potencia deitatis mee fecisse. g Quomodo ergo illi merentur intrare in gloriam meam, qui modicam habent fidem, spem vanam et 20 caritatem nullam?

Si haberent caritatem diuinam, 25 cogitarent saltem in animo, quid feci pro eis, quantus michi labor in predicacione, quantus dolor in passione, quanta michi caritas in morte, scilicet quod prius volui mori quam eos relinquere. 8 Sed fides eorum est c infirma et quasi pendet in eis, cicius minans casum, quia credunt absente 3 0 temptacionis impulsu, diffidunt autem accedente aliquo contrario. 9 Spes eorum est vana, quia sperant peccatum sine iusticia et veritate iudicii dimitti. Regnum celorum confidunt optinere gratis. Misericor- diam meam absque temperamento iusticie optinere cupiunt. ro Caritas eorum ad me tota est frigida, quia numquam accenduntur ad querendum 35 me, nisi tribulacione cogantur. Quomodo cum talibus possum calefieri, qui nec fidem habent rectam nec spem firmam nec caritatem ad me feruentem? II Ideo, cum clamauerint ad me et dixerint 'Miser e r e me i, D eus!', non merentur audiri nec intrare in gloriam meam, quia nolunt sequi Dominum suum ad passionem, ideo nec sequentur eum ad glo- 40 riam. 12 Nullus enim miles placere potest domino suo et in graciam eius post lapsum recipi, nisi prius aliquam humilitatem fecerit ei pro con- temptu suo.>> 29 cicius = cito. 32 dimitti pro 'dimissum iri' (cfr H—Sz 358). optinere pro 'se obtenturos esse'. 37 psalm. § II cfr I Petr. 4, 13 sqq. 5o, 3; cfr Rev.

Benedictus sis tu ab omni exercitu ioo tuo, quia facis nos videre et scire in te omnia, que facta sunt et futura sunt! 36 In te enim omnia videmus et scimus.

Nam deitas conclusit me in se cum anima et corpore et impleuit me omni virtute, ut non sit virtus in 20 Deo, que non splendeat in me, quamuis ipse Deus est pater et dator omnium virtutum.

Ego excusabo me in conspectu omnium sanctorum coram primo, qui dixit me corpus habere indecentissimum, et probabo me habere veraciter corpus honestissimum sine deformitate et peccato, et ipse veniet in obprobrium sempiternum, quod omnes videbunt. 18 65 Ille autem, qui dicebat mea verba mendacium et nescire, utrum Deus sum an non, probabo me esse veraciter Deum, et ipse quasi lutum de- fluet in infernum. 19 Tercius autem, qui iudicauit me vilissimum, ego iudicabo eum ad eternam dampnacionem, ut numquam videat gloriam meam et gaudium meum.>> 70 zo Deinde ait ad sponsam: »Sta firmiter in seruicio meo!

Capitulum XL VII. 5 / >> Ego sum Deus ille, qui olim dicebatur D eus Abraham et D eus Ysaac et D eus Iac ob. Ego sum Deus, qui dedi legem Moysi. Hec erat A quasi vestis. Sicut enim mater, que habet infantem in ventre, preparat vestes puero, sic Deus preparauit legem, que non erat nisi vestis et umbra et signa futurorum faciendorum. 2 Ego autem vestiui me et inuolui me io in istis vestibus legis. Deinde sicut crescente puero mutatur habitus anti- quus et assumitur nouus, sic ego, completa et deposita veste antique legis, assumpsi nouam vestem, idest legem nouam, et dedi omnibus, qui voluerunt habere vestes mecum. 3 Vestis autem ista non est stricta vel difficilis sed ubique moderata. 1 5 Non enim precipit nimis ieiunare vel laborare vel se occidere vel aliquid ultra possibilitatem facere, sed proficua est ad animam et ad corpus mo- derandum et castigandum apta. 4 Corpus enim cum nimium peccato adheret, ipsum peccatum corpus consumit. 5 In lege ergo noua duo inueniuntur: primo discreta temperancia et rectus usus omnium rerum anime et corporis; secundo facilitas seruandi 20 legem, quia, qui non potest stare in uno, potest in alio. 6 Ibi inuenitur, 2 mali sacerdotes cfr Rev.

Dicunt enim legem ipsam strictam esse, grauem et deformem. Stric- 25 tarn dicunt earn, quia lex precipit contentari de necessariis et fugere superflua. Ipsi autem volunt habere omnia extra racionem quasi iumenta super vires corporis. Ideo stricta est eis. 8 Dicunt earn secundo esse grauem, quia lex dicit voluptatem cum racione habere et temporibus constitutis. Sed ipsi volunt perficere suam 3 0 voluptatem plus quam expedit et plus quam constitutum est. 9 Tercio dicunt earn esse deformem, quia lex iubet diligere humilitatem et Deo omne bonum ascribere. Ipsi autem volunt de bonis, a Deo datis, super- bire et se extollere. Ideo est eis deformis. Ecce sic contempta est vestis mea. 35 iv Ego omnia priora compleui et incepi noua, quia antiqua nimis erant difficilia, ut durarent, usquequo venirern ad iudicium.

Aut que deterior prodicio quam ubi duo, in- dissolubili vinculo iuncti, alius alium prodit, utputa coniuges? 25 Quid 8o autem facit consors, cum prodere voluerit consortem? Vere dicit ei sub simulacione: 'Eamus ad locum ilium, ut impleam tecum voluntatem meam!' Illa autem in vera simplicitate, parata ad omnem voluntatem consortis, vadit cum eo. 26 Sed cum oportunum tempus et locum inue- nerit, producit contra earn tria instrumenta prodicionis.

Magis enim loquuntur centum verba pro mundo quam pro honore meo unum. Magis darent centum marcas auri G pro mundo quam unum denarium pro me. Magis cencies laborarent pro 105 propria utilitate et mundi quam semel pro meo honore. Hoc onere depri- munt me, quasi mortuus sim a cordibus eorum. 32 Secundo pungunt me quasi acuto ferro, quod intrat in viscera, quando sacerdos accedit ad altare et cogitat se peccasse et penitet, habens firmam voluntatem peccandi iterum peracto officio, cogitando secum: '10 'Bene peniteo de peccato, sed non relinquam illam a me, cum qua peccaui, ita quod non amplius faciam.' Isti quasi ferro acutissimo me pungunt. 33 Tercio quasi suffocatur spiritus, cum cogitant secum sic: 'Bonum et delectabile est esse cum mundo, bonum est luxuriari et non possum continere. Faciam voluntatem meam in iuuentute. Cum autem senuerim, 1 5 tunc abstinere volo et me emendare.' Et ex ista pessima cogitacione suffocatur spiritus. 34 Sed queritur, quomodo.

Horum iudicium est malediccio. Sicut maledixit Dauid eis, qui non obediunt 145 Deo, — qui, cum esset iustus propheta et rex, non maledixit ex ira vel mala voluntate seu ex impaciencia sed ex iusticia Dei — sic ego, qui melior sum Dauid, maledico eis, qui sunt sacerdotes, non ex ira vel voluntate mala sed ex iusticia. 41 Maledictum ergo sit omne, quod de terra ad utilitatem suam receperint, quia non laudant Deum et creatorem 1 50 suum, qui dedit eis hec. Maledictus sit cibus et potus eorum, qui intrat in os eorum, qui pauit corpus in cibum vermium et animam ad infer- num. 42 Maledictum sit corpus eorum, quod resurget in inferno sine fine arsurum. Maledicti sint anni eorum, quibus vixerunt inutiliter. Maledicta sit hora, que incipit eis in inferno et numquam finietur. 43 1 55 Maledicti sint oculi eorum, quibus viderunt lumen celi.

Si deleueris eos, ubi est tunc promissio tua? Ne, queso, facias hoc, quia tunc dicent inimici tui: Malus est Deus Israel, qui eduxit populum de mari et interfecit eos in deserto.'

Et displicuit eis, quod eduxerit eos de captiuitate, dicentes: 'Queramus 35 alium Deum, qui nos precedat!' 9 Sic nunc faciunt michi isti maledicti sacerdotes.

Ipsi enim sacerdotes, qui deberent esse mei, accidiosi sunt ad honorem meum, impacientes ad ferendum, nimii in gaudio et numquam contentantur de optentis. Iste vitulus habet eciam caput et guttur, idest voluntatem omnem so ad gulam, ut numquam saciari possit, eciam si influeret totum mare. Cauda vero huius vituli est malicia eorum, quia nullum permitterent possidere sua, si possent. /3 Vulnerant enim et subuertunt omnes, qui seruiunt michi, exemplo suo prauo et contemptu. Talis amoris vitulus est in cordibus eorum. Ad talem gaudent et delectantur. 14 De me, sicut 55 illi de Moyse, cogitant: 'Diu', inquiunt, 'defuit. Verba sua videntur vana et opera onerosa.

Ipsi offerunt michi thus, E idest loquuntur et predicant verba pulchra ad laudem propriam et ad habendum aliquid temporale, non ex caritate mea. zo Ideo sicut odor thuris non capitur sed sentitur et videtur, sic verba eorum non veniunt 70 ad effectum animarum, ut radicari vel teneri possint corde, sed audiuntur solummodo verba et quasi ad tempus delectare videntur. 2/ Offerunt preces, sed nullo modo michi placabiles. Sicut illi, qui clamant ore lau- dem et silent corde, stant quasi iuxta me ore clamantes sed corde cir- cumuagantur mundum. 22 Si enim deberent loqui homini alicuius digni- 75 tatis, cor haberent cum locucione, ne deuiarent in loquendo, ne forte in aliquibus notarentur. 23 Apud me autem orant sacerdotes quasi homines, qui sunt in extasi, qui aliud loquuntur ore et aliud habent in corde.

'Interfice eos, qui hoc idolum fecerunt!' Ubi si aliqui sunt interfecti, non tamen omnes.

Ecce maledicti sacerdotes quid dicunt! Ego sto ante eos quasi ouis mitissima, de qua sumunt lanam ad vestiendum et lac ad reficiendum et 20 adhuc pro tanta dileccione abhominantur me. 6 Ego sto ante eos quasi hospes, qui dicit: 'Amice, da michi necessaria vite, quia indigeo, et recipe mercedem optimam a Deo!' 7 Sed ipsi pro ouis simplicitate repellunt me quasi lupum insidiantem ouibus patris familias.

Ipse enim habuit in lege potestatem super populum meum, ac si fuisset conclusus in pugno suo. Tu autem conclusisti omnium legum dominum in utero tuo.

Tu autem, carissima mater mea, anima tua assumpta fuit super omnes choros angelorum ad thronum Dei et cum ea est mundissimum corpus tuum. Ideo tu alcior Helia. 7 Tercius mons erat fortitudo Sampsonis, quam habuit super omnes homines. Tamen vicit eum diabolus fallacia sua. Tu autem vicisti 25 diabolum fortitudine tua. Ideo tu forcior Sampsone. 8 Quartus mons erat Dauid, qui fuit vir secundum cor meum et voluntatem meam et tamen cecidit in peccatum. Tu autem, mater mea, sequebaris omnem voluntatem meam et numquam peccasti. 9 Quintus mons erat Salomon, qui fuit plenus sapiencia. Tamen fuit infatuatus.

Et nulli adhuc negas, qui racionabiliter petit suam utilitatem. Et ideo mititas tua excellencior est angelis. 17 Quartum folium est pulchritudo tua.

Tu es archa illa, que erat in lege, in qua erant tria, scilicet virga, manna et tabule. 4 Cum virga facta sunt tria. Primo mutata est in serpentem, qui erat sine veneno. Secundo per earn mare diuisum est. Tercio de petra 5 educta est aqua. 5 Ego sum virga ilia in figura, qui in ventre tuo iacui et humanitatem de to accepi. Ego primo, sicut serpens Moysi, sic terribilis sum inimicis meis. Ipsi quippe fugiunt a me quasi a conspectu serpentis, pauent a me et abhominantur quasi serpentem, cum tamen ego sim sine veneno malicie, plenus omni misericordia. 6 Ego pacior me teneri ab 20 eis, si voluerint, ego reuertor ad eos, si me quesierint. Curro ad eos quasi mater ad filium perditum et inuentum, si me inuocauerint. Exhibeo eis misericordiam meam et dimitto peccata eorum, si clamauerint. Hoc facio eis, et adhuc abhominantur me quasi serpentem. Secundo per virgam istam diuisum est mare, quando via ad celum, B 25 que clausa erat per peccatum, per sanguinem et dolorem meum aperie- batur. Tunc certe rumpebatur mare et inuium factum est via, quando dolor omnium membrorum meorum accessit ad cor et cor pre violencia doloris ruptum est. 8 Postea traducto populo per mare non duxit eos Moyses statim in terram promissionis sed in desertum, ut ibi probaren- 3 0 tur et instruerentur. g Sic et nunc accepta fide et mandato meo non 12 sq. archa tabule vide v. 2; Klockars 81. § 4 cfr Rev.

 LIBRI PRIMI CAP. 53 411 statim introducitur populus in celum, sed necesse est, ut in deserto, idest in mundo, probentur homines, quomodo diligunt Deum. 10 Sed per tria prouocauit populus Deum in deserto. Primo quia fecerunt sibi idolum et adorauerunt ipsum. Secundo quia concupierunt carnes, quas 35 habuerant in Egypto. Tercio per superbiam, quando sine voluntate Dei ascendere voluerunt et pugnare cum inimicis. II Sic nunc eciam peccat homo contra me in mundo. Primo colit idolum, quia plus amat mundum et que in eo sunt quam me, qui eorum creator sum. 12 Sed mundus quippe est deus eorum, non ego. Ego enim 40 dixi in euangelio meo: 'U b i est thesaurus hominis, i b i est c or eius.' Sic thesaurus hominis est mundus, quia ad hunc habet cor swum, non ad me. 13 Ideo, sicut illi in deserto corruerunt gladio in corpore, sic isti cadent in gladio eterne dampnacionis ad animam, in qua sine fine viuent. 14 Secundo peccauerunt per concupiscenciam carnium. Ego enim dedi c 45 homini omnia necessaria ad honestatem et ad moderanciam, sed ipse omnia vult habere immoderate et indiscrete. 15 Ipse enim, si sufficeret natura, sine cessacione vellet commisceri, sine refrenacione bibere, sine modo concupiscere. Quamdiu enim posset peccare, numquam cessaret a peccato. 16 Ideo continget eis, sicut illis in deserto, quod morientur 5 0 subitanea morte. Quid enim est vita istius temporis nisi quasi quidam punctus ad eternitatem? Propterea quasi subitanea morte morientur in corpore propter breuitatem huius vite et viuent in pena ad animam sine fine. § z o cfr exod. 33 prouocauit =iratum fecit; cfr 16, 3; 32; num.

Calefacit autem non sicut ignis materialis aut sicut sol visibilis aliquid liquefaciens, sed calor eius est amor internus anime et desiderium, replens et absorbens animam in Deum. s Dulcescit eciam anime, non 15 sicut vinum desiderabile aut voluptas vel aliquid aliud mundanum, sed dulcedo illa spiritus incomparabilis est omnibus dulcoribus temporalibus et inexcogitabilis non sapientibus illam. 6 Tercio est spiritus ille sic mundus quemadmodum radii solis, in quibus nulla macula inueniri possit. 20 7 Secundus spiritus, qui est creatus, similiter habet tria. Est enim ardens, est amarus, est et immundus. 8 Primo est ardens et consumens quasi ignis, quia animam, quam possidet, totam incendit igne luxurie et praue cupiditatis, ut anima preter eius explecionem nichil aliud cogitare, nichil desiderare possit in tantum, quod quandoque propter illam amit- 25 titur vita temporalis et omnis honor et consolacio. 9 Secundo est amarus quasi fel, quia animam sic sua delectacione inflammat, quod gaudia futura videntur ei esse nulla et bona eterna fatuitas. Omnia quoque, que de Deo sunt et que tenetur ei facere, amarescunt ei et abhominabilia sunt ei quasi vomitus et quasi fel. ID Tercio est immundus, quia animam sic 3 0 vilem facit et pronam ad peccatum, ut de nullo peccato erubescat et a nullo peccato desisteret, si non plus hominum timeret verecundiam quam Dei. 14 Dulcescit vide v. 9. 16 dulcedo illa spiritus eqs. cfr Aug. conf. 2, I, 1 >ut t11 (sc.

Ideo autem est immundus, quia ipse delectatur ex immundicia et alios similes secum querit habere. /2 Sed nunc querere potes et dicere michi: 'Numquid non tu es eciam c spiritus creatus sicut ille? Quare ergo tu non es talis?' 13 Respondeo tibi: vere ego creatus sum ab eodem Deo, quo et ipse, quia non est nisi 40 unus Deus, Pater et Filius et Spiritus sanctus, et hii non tres dii, sed unus Deus. Et ambo bene creati sumus et ad bonum, quia Deus nichil nisi bonum creauit. 14 Sed ego sum quasi stella, quia in bonitate et cari- tate Dei, in qua creatus sum, steti. Ipse autem est quasi carbo, quia a caritate Dei discessit. /5 Ergo, sicut stella non est sine claritate et splen- 45 dore nec carbo sine nigredine, sic angelus bonus, qui est quasi stella, non est sine splendore, idest Spiritu sancto. 16 Omne enim, quod habet, hoc habet a Deo, Patre scilicet et Filio et Spiritu sancto.

Capitulum )>Ego sum similis potenti domino, qui edificans ciuitatem imposuit ei nomen ex suo nomine. Deinde construxit in ciuitate palacium, in quo mansiuncule diuerse pro necessaries capiendis erant. Constructo vero palacio et rebus suis ordinatis populum suum disposuit in tres partes dicens: 2 'Vie mee sunt ad remotas partes. State et laborate viriliter pro .0 honore meo! Constitui enim vobis necessaria vestra et victualia. Habetis et iudices, qui vos iudicent. Habetis defensores, qui vos ab inimicis de- fendant. 3 Constitui et laboratores, qui vos pascant, et de labore suo decimam partem michi persoluent et utilitati mee et honori reseruabunt.' 4 Interiecto autem aliquo tempore nomen ciuitatis oblitum est. Tune 15 dixerunt iudices: 'Dominus noster ad remotas partes profectus est. Iudicemus rectum iudicium et faciamus iusticiam, ut redeunte domino nostro non arguamur sed reportemus honorem et benediccionem.'

Hee sunt Iudei, qui stant quasi sub velamine. Qui libenter procederent, si scirent pro certo me natum. 3o Occultant autem se quasi sub velamento, quia in figuris et in signis, que me in lege significabant et in me vera- 85 citer completa sunt, sperant salutem et ex illa vana spe timent ad fidem rectam procedere. 31 Tercie oues, que in luto stant, sunt Christiani, in F mortalibus peccatis constituti.

Capitulum LX. Filius loquebatur ad sponsam dicens: #Ego sum Deus Israel et ille, qui cum Moyse loquebatur. Moyses, cum ad populum meum mitteretur, peciit signum aliquod, dicens: 'Non credit michi aliter populus.' z Si ergo erat populus Domini, ad quern Moyses mittebatur, quare diffidebat? Sed scire debes, quod in populo illo tria genera hominum erant. 3 Qui- io dam credebant Deo et Moysi. Secundi erant, qui credebant Deo et diffi- debant de Moyse, reputantes, ne forte ex adinuencione propria et pre- sumpcione talia loqui vel facere presumeret. Tercii erant, qui nec Deo nec Moysi credebant. 4 Sic nunc tria genera hominum sunt inter Christianos, qui in He- Is breis signantur. Aliqui sunt, qui bene credunt Deo et verbis meis.

Ideo et consumpti sunt misera morte, sed hoc non fecerunt nisi illi soli, qui malam fidem habuerunt. 6 Propterea, quia humanus animus tardus est ad credendum, ideo amicus meus transferet verba mea ad eos, qui credunt ei. Ipsi postmo- 25 dum diffundent ad alios, qui nesciunt discernere inter bonum spiritum et malum. 7 Si autem audientes pecierint signum, ostendant eis virgam, sicut Moyses fecit, idest verba mea explanent eis. Sicut enim virga Moysi recta erat et terribilis propter immutacionem in serpentem, sic verba mea recta sunt, ut nulla in eis inueniatur falsitas. 8 Terribilia sunt, 3 0 quia iudicium rectum sonant. Proponant et testificentur, quod ad ver- bum et sonum unius oris cessit et recessit diabolus a Dei creatura, qui, nisi potestate mea refrenaretur, eciam mouere posset montes.

 Glossarium In my edition of the above text there occur quite a large number of words, some of them new formations, with new, special Medieval Latin meanings, differing from the meanings of these words in Classical and in Late Latin. When compiling this glossary I have made it a principle to include, in the first place, such words and constructions as are either completely missing from, or whose meanings relevant to the text are not sufficiently supported by, examples in K. E. Georges, Attsfiihrliches lat.-deutsches Handworterbuch, 9. Aufl., Basel, 1951. The critical reader will find certain deviations from this principle, but they have been made, as it appears to me, with the commendable intention of further facili- tating the understanding of the text for the interested reader with a limited know- ledge of Medieval Latin. References to the most important dictionaries of mainly Medieval and Late Latin and to certain other works (e.g. to H-Sz, who often give more exhaustive information about relevant literature) have been given for most articles. I have used the following abbreviations for dictionaries mentioned: Ai =Arnaldi, Be — Blaise, B1 = Bartal, Br = Brinckmeier, D-B = Deferrari-Barry, DuC = Du Cange, Fi = Forcellini, H1= Habel, Hm = Hammarstrom, I-Is = Hakamies, Lm = Latham, L-S = Lewis-Short, MW = Mittellateinisches Worterbuch, N G1= Novum Glos- sarium, Nn =Neuman, Nr = Niermeyer, S = Sella, Glossario latino emiliano, Sa = Sella, Glossario latino italiano, Slr = Sleumer, Sr = Souter, TLL = Thesaurus linguae Latinae, W =Westerbergh. Complete titles of these and other works cited in the glossary are to be found in the Bibliography, pp. xi sqq. Certain phenomena of mainly syntactical and stylistic character are listed in the Index reruns etc., pp. 506 ff. abhominabilis adi., i.q. abominabilis: Prol. M.: 34, 35, 37; Rev. 21: 14; 23: 1; al.
