proposal



this is me -

this is, what I

demand






from the mate,

which is to be mine -:



when she is near me,

we shall be born from god -,

when I am with her,

we shall beget the prince,

for whom the world is waiting -



when I leave her,

to risk my life with my icy fate,

her pride shall conquer

easily her womb -



when I beg her to heal

my tired-to-death despair,

she,

with steel-hard courage,

shall show me again and again

the way which may hold out

the destruction of me,

her man -

her eye

shall be the merciless

killer of my will to die -

her foot

shall be the burning sceptre

to my victorious joy -

her life

shall be the voice

of my blood -

I shall call her

my woman -
