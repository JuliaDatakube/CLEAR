my prayer



o god -,

o god -,

my sight will turn hazy -!



the limping,

out-reaching fear

does break the purity

of creative rhythm -,

the worshipping falsity

of hopeless fear

does lock the ears

to the resounding power

of creative pride -



god, give me

the forcing translation

of the urge in the storm,

of the voice in the rising sun -,

give me

the binding power,

that ropes-in the many,

that forces the frightened

into the rhythm

of creative will -



god, show me

the name of my mate,

the only -,

that, like a column of blood, my tree

may stand out -

god,

this is my prayer -
