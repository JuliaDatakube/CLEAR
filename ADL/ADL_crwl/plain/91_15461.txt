a little song



I have killed mary ann's god -

mary ann dreads my god -

I love mary ann -

when the burning blackness stands out before me,

I leave mary ann

to her love of me -






when the pale sun rises

with its blue morning-wet eyes,

I return to mary ann

with my love of her -

poor mary ann -

and poor me -

but we have a great heart

together -

mary ann and I -
