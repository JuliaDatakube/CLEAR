the god of the blood(2 song)




the old gods are dead,

the old humanities are dead -

the old priests are liars -







the women of the old

are wicked with no soul in their blood -,

the men of the old

are beggars with no will in their blood -

the white blood of the old

is the world's poison

and the dragon before the world's treasures -



I am alone,

I have found no mate,

I am a half,

I am proud,

but I am nothing yet,

l obey and I wait,

and I hide my sword -



I know, the god of goodness

is dead -,

died in his own onliness -

his timidity devoured him

unborn -

I know, the god of goodness

has nothing left -,

owns nothing himself -,

has nothing to give -



I know, the goddess of love

is mouldering away,

withering deep in her own barrenness -

her wine was a sterile fire,

her goldenness an evil shade -

I know, the impoverished goddess of love

has nothing left -

her withered limbs have no heat left

to warm her age -

she has nothing to give -








you dark god

behind -, underneath -!

you severe god,

with black face

and the blood-red hands

and the silent eyes

and the streaming, unhearable voice -,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who held forth the others,

the weak ones, the pale and the powerless,

which are now dead,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who exerts your power without man's devotion,

you who knows our names,

which we cannot see ourselves -,

show us your face -!

kill the dying powerless gods

from the lost humanities -,

do free us from the nonpotent ashes

of bewildered man -!



in the cleaving paws of the night,

on the white at the bottom of the blood-proud sun,

behind the potent helmet of the gathering moon

I hear the voice -, streaming -

I hear,

and I obey -



but your name,

I want your face,

you with the two streams of life

in your right hand -

and the two black feathers of death

in your left hand,

I want your face,

your name -!







you, the only god -,

you, who was always behind,

underneath -, you who let die

the revengeful jehovah and the allforgiving christ,

you, who has destroyed the joyous realm of mammon,

stand out,

show us your hands -!

we are waiting -,

to obey -

we know, we are nothing apart from you,

give us back the old faculties

from before the reign of man,

give us back our righteous names -,

and our righteous piaces,

give to our men the will towards you,

which is all will,

and the only -,

give to our women the longing for you,

which is all longing -,

and the only -

give to the earth

and the sun and moon

the proportion which is you,

and you only -

we claim everything from you,

we have robbed ourselves of everything -!



o, we know that happiness is not in

youreye,

we know that blessed love is not in

yourcrown -,

we have caught your streaming voice

from far-off -!

we wantyoursway upon our blood,

we wantreality, which is you,

we want the right,

not love nor joy,

youare our want,







youto come inourhands, our eyes,

youto wander, swaying, throughourveins -

we know you,

o, we know you,

you black god of rightness -,

do crush our earth between

the fingers of your right hand -,

let come forth the marrow of our ill-used earth,

still waiting -

we, the last men and women of this earth,

we beg you to take our nakedness and

rule us again -!

o, black god, we beg you to give us back your severity

over our crippled blood,

we beg of you, o god,

nothing but the sight of your two hands -,

the two streams of life

and the black feathers of death,

we want your sword to wander among us

as before the reign of man -



we men of god,

we won't be reigned by anointedmen,

we, the men of god,

we want back our righteous chief -

- the men of god do wantyou

god -!
