hidden striving



there is silence in my world -

therefore I sing low songs through the nights -

the silence creeps mistlike,

eating my world -

the small things I know

will not answer

the great things I need -

the low songs of my faith

cannot stop

the bleeding of hunger's blood -

but the nights are innumerable -,

I'll work 'pon my tunes,

till they shine flickering,

hazy like old weapons -,

till they stand like pale noble cans

dripping with dangerous wine -

I shall sate silence,

night by night,

with exquisitely carved instruments, and pearls

beyond value -

- low songs creep mistlike,

seeking the faith of silence -
