what is there



what is there

but eternal giving away

of yourself,






and eternal being born

anew to yourself -?

what is there

but millions of strange gods

in the sea, in the sun,

in the air,

gods and gods and gods,

dangerous and sometimes mild -?

what is there

but thousands of loves

in wombs, in hearts,

in the earth,

love and love and love,

murderous and sometimes like bread -?

what is there

but eternally being too weak

and eternally being stronger

than yourself -?
