the dawn is grey over the sea



my race is as old

as the earth,

and my race is as rich -

but I

was born young,

my parents I couldn't find

and my kingdom neither -

my servants will not obey me,

and the women around me I scorn -






am I the last

cry of a drowning wave,

or am I the fresh-born foam

of the first approaching breakers

along an unknown shore -?



the patience of my pride

has no limits -

but the eye of my maledom

is blind -
