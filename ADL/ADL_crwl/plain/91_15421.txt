the song of the useless



no wine don't help

nothing -

we have tried that too -






its gentleness is not

cruel enough -

there is nothing untried

to us -

don't wait

for notcoming cure -!

rather take all your

defects and hold forth

as ugly and

disgusting, as you ever can -,

the quite whole of

your scanty defects -

perhaps it'll help -

no wine in the world

really don't help

nothing -



we are quite a lot of us,

we will go all over the world

carrying an enormous banner

of disgusting rottenness

with us - who can tell,

perhaps it'll help -

we are quite a lot -

and no wine

will never help -

what we

have got, is not very enticing -

don't hide it away -!

do show it

high over the world

as a banner of future,

mightier than

oppressive beauty -!

perhaps it shall

be able

to kill all lying happiness

with sound disgust -
