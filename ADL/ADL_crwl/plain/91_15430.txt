rejected



sadness is

in my veins,

anger has filled my eyes,

my lips are dry with ashes -



my goodwill has turned to hatred,

my hope is an unworthy slave,

but my sight is clean as a spear,

and I see,

and I know,

o, I know,

the people of mine has refused

myservice -!






the people of mine

is happy -

but its prayers

are humble -

the world won't give

my people more money -!

the women can't give

the men no more pride -!

my people is happy -,

but my people is praying -



my people is licking its own holy corpse,

is biting in worship and hopeful resentment

the sacred parts -,

my countrymen don't like their devoted servant,

they cry -:

who are you,

to profaneourcandid devotion,

who areyou,

to call down the anger

of god 'pon the heads of your worshipping people -!



- my lips are dry with ashes -

I know why -
