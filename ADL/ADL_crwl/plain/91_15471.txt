blindness



I have built a great tower,

sort of enormous light-house

to my inner eye -

each stone above another

is a pride,

each stone above another

is another pride -

and each pride

is stronger and more hard

than the other -

the colour of each stone

is red from love -

never-sated love, sharp

like rubies -

the eye on top of the tower,

blind from mad pride,

is hunger,

hunger,

hunger -

lifted like a bright axe,

threatening the sun

and the sky,

a dry, mad eye,

more proud than the sun at noon

over a pale sea -
