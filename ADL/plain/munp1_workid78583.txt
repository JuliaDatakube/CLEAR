such is my loverocky souls on the way, wheresupreme delightis but beautifying sleep -,such is my lovethat if you are stricken with mortal painbecause of me,it is a thousand times better thanhad you never met me -if with unclean handsI steal your sacred crown,you shall be a thousand times more pure,when I have left -and if for my joyyou are killed in the meanest way,by my hand your lips shall reach,awakening, the brow of The Most High -listen, every lonesome rocky soul:not one minute anyone of you are left -!such is my love for each of you -
