modest love-tune



ah -, I've found something -!

ah -, I love my flesh and my bones -

and my sweat and my marrow bones -

my body does give

me, what I want -,

my body denies me,

what I shouldn't want -



my body is no female body,

my body is not a price

to be paid for anything -






my body is no worker,

my body isn't no handle

of any machine -

and not the servant

of any prayer -

my body is me,

ah -, I love you, my shoulders, my knees -!



I do feel well

inyourcompany -,

you can't be flattered,

it is done -,

I can't be touched,

when I am with you -,

I'm glad, I've caught you at last,

you-,

me -!
