the song of the lonesome warrior- manis the one action -- manis the only real -- manis the world to come -the earthmust be loved by men -the wretched partsof the futile will to be menis stabbingthe patient heart of the earth,crying :"behold, wehave subdued this lazy servant -,soon she will love us -"soon she will die -the last of her voiceare the remnants of man -the earthmust be loved by men -,not by waiters,and buyersand sellers -no part can love -,- only man can love -- you mourning remnants, - awake -!the reign of the seekers is finished -- manis the only real -- manis the world to come -
