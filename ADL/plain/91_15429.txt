moon behind clouds



find your god,

or you can't live -!

the gods are waiting

motionless inflexible -

the black god

of the eagle is standing,

his dark, closed face turned away,

waiting -






the red god of the snake,

coiling with locked lips,

ready, ready -

the green god

of the grass with

silent blades,

awake, awake -

the unseen god,

watching for the blood to walk,

claiming, claiming -

find your god -,

or you can't live -!



you may worship the pale breed

of the selves -,

pace, begging, towards the smiling

woman o f death -

- the gods

are waiting,

waiting -!
