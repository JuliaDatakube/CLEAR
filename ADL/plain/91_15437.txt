whisper



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your hand,

your slim, patient hand -,

I want to touch your fingers -,

to watch your pale-brown face

turn -



my heart is a knot

of ill-treated scars

in my tight-screwed fist -

pale-brown girl,

I am afraid of every movement -

your soft, black eyes

do graze my brow -

will you heal me -?

can you -?



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your fingers -

I am afraid of every movement -

let your sad, black eyes

rest on my brow -

I have no tears,

and my strength has gone -
