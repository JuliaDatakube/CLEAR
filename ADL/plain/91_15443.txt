the smile



you old woman

with the cutting sparks

behind the slow glance -,

with lips as a slash in a lonely fir -,

with teeth as lurking anger -,

ah you -!

ah you -, you -!



I'll drive you

slowly, slowly towards the immovable precipice -,

I'll laugh at your sneering retreat -,

I'll snap at your lingering heel,

you wicked love-hater -,

I'll crush your sunken bosom,

and

on the outmost brink

I'll bite your murderous joy,

I'll love you to ripeness hard as flint -,

you -, ah

you -, dear -!
