to my dancing-partner



we are

the real action,

we are

together,

we are

the Dance -



you are

my perfect instrument,

I am

your perfect voice,

we play what we

do know,

we are

the instrument to play

what there is to know -



I love

your heart in my bow -

you love

my blood in your song -

together

we carve out a star -,

together

we make a new life -

we are

the real action,

we are

the Dance -
