where is laughter -?



when I sing songs

to the Unknown which made me burn,

there is laughter in my heart -

when I dance the rhythm

of life in honour of the gods of Blood,

there is laughter hissing

somewhere -

when I pour my joy into some open womb

to feel breed of the Earth in my buttocks,

there is big laughter sending roots

into soil -

o where, where is laughter -?



to fight death like the men of my tribe

is to behold

armies of flaring laughters

between the world and

you always -

o where, where is laughter -?

to hunt death in silent anger

by day and by night

as the price of sleep,

is life -

o where, where is laughter -?
