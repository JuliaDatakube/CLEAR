a little songI have killed mary ann's god -mary ann dreads my god -I love mary ann -when the burning blackness stands out before me,I leave mary annto her love of me -when the pale sun riseswith its blue morning-wet eyes,I return to mary annwith my love of her -poor mary ann -and poor me -but we have a great hearttogether -mary ann and I -
