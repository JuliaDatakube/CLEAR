the song of my tribethe men of my tribeare mostly silentand most of daysthey go wanderingtowards some unknown calling -the men of my tribeare mostly seriousand most of daysthey go thinkinghow far off the rest of their hearts do linger -the men of my tribe are mostly hungry but on certain days they sate their bodies and souls in short joy -the men of my tribeare on the way towards the desertsand the staring caves where life has hiddert,to make their fires there -the men of my tribe are mostly silent -
