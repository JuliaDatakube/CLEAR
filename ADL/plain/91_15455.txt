hymn



the house of my certainty

is so vast

that I never can touch its walls -



the room of my deepest desire

is so sacred

that none but my friend and my woman

can be permitted to enter -



the tower of my watchman's eye

is so high

that the fall of my death

never can reach

the aim of my fear -



the sword of my pride

is so hard

that never the corroding impurity

assembled from all the world

can stain its brightness -






to every upright soul in distress

the house of my certainty

is open -

to every fighting will of blood

my gleaming eye

is the unfailing sign of victory,

of inexhaustible rest -

to every succumbing purity

the garden of my healing love

is prepared

with unvanquished tenderness -



the house of my certainty

is nobody's property -

I

am the ever-watching opener

of its silent gate -
