the ringI have broken the floor of my loneliness -I dig the claws of my soul deep into the rock - downwards, downwards -the rock of darknesshas devoured me -all directionsbut one are torn asunder -downwards, downwards -!I have broken the floorof my loneliness -softly, softlyI sink through the mountainsof blindness -soonI shall eat the scentof the hearts of my brothers -soon my dropcan't be distinguishedfrom those of my brothers -soon the riverwill close the ring of future -
