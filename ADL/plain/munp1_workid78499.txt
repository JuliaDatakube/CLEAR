early morning
(to carmelo)my infinite world isin the closed egg of my will towards god -every finished pieceof joy and clean bitternessis put aside on the deep bottom of the sacred eye -always has god's heat been over me andshall always be till perfection breaks throughthe vast forest of my world -his face is of no use for my timefilling work -at some close or approaching timethe egg of my world will open,my work shall stop -,and eternal repeating of that single act of god,which is me,shall be the sign that my will may go -
