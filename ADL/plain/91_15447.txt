brother -!



don't fight

your own silent will -

don't build barriers

on the only way of your soul -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

bright behind the shabby clothes

of the un-real -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

waiting, ready

to stand out






free and strong

to its own brightness -



don't fight

your own silent will -

stand out

naked to your own soul -

pull off

the contaminated rags

of imperious death-will -,

leave behind you

the strangling chain of the dread

of life uncovered -



do walk

silent the way of your deepest being -

nothing there is

to change -

the will

of the sun and the unconquerable blood

is you too -
