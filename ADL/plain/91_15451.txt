the ruler



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

my wealth has no limits -,

and my cruelty neither -

nothing can hinder

the growth of my power -,

not even the steel-hard grasp

of my dark-blue hand

can direct

the fall of corroding drops

from my jet-black star -

I am the ruler -

but the unchecked growth of my power

is threatening even the ground

of the deep-bolted f eet of my soul -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

but my eyes are tired

of condemning

what has always been dead -,

and my eyes can't like

what they themselves have created -

I am the ruler -

but my neck is tired

of its own inflexible pride -

my heart of blood

is tired of kissing what it has born itself -






I am the ruler -

but I say -:

I would break my unshaken crown

to get love

not created by me -,

I would give my invincible power

to get love,

whose fire could feed itself -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

I want to be robbed of my riches -,

I am tired of giving

my presents of fate -

I am the ruler -

I want my strength to forsake me -,

and my lust of creation -

there is too much blood in my eyes -,

and too much murdering purity

has left my hand already -



I am the ruler -

but my crown is stronger than I -

I am the ruler -

but my power has beaten my will -

the ring of my crown is unbroken -
