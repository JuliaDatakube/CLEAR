leaving



don't believe

one more word

from any lips -

all words are poisoned -

only believe

what your eyes will love,

and your fingers want to touch -

there is a great sleep

still rising in all nature -

seek your rest there -

then

your eyes can't be deceived,

then






your eyes shall know their love

and their enemy without question,

and your fingers shall unlock

never-opened doors,

which must be opened -

and then

your soul will have no more goals

and no more words wherewith

to build evil walls,

wherewith to make unclean arms -

there is still the great sleep waiting -
