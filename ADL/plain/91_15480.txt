there's still riches



what do we care about anything

but the real thing -!

what are the systems of mankind to us -?






wewant the pearl that's cheap like grey stone,

the gust of wind, precious like our mother's heart -

o, no -!

there's still some cruel laughter bidden in our blood,

still rich.es clinging to our bare hands -

oh no - oh no -!

still we're too cautious

to put in our lot with mankind's -

o, no -!

the tribes don't speak each others' tongues,

why should they -!

oh -, our pride is still a good tent

'gainst mankind's dry winds -

isn't our laughter too sharp -?

oh yes - yes - it is -!

what dowecare about anything

but the real thing -?

what is the sick clamour of mankind to us -?

ifourdeath will visit us,

we'll receive her duly -

but mankind's -?

oh no, she has too easy wings -

o, no to us there's still riches waiting

on our bare, wet rocks -
