at the bottom



nobody knows what he wants -

the good are timid -,

the strong are devils -,

the wise are barren -,

the fertile seduced

to geld their fruits -

- where are you,

where are you tenderness, certainty -?

where

are you hiding -,

where do you hide -,

in readiness for

us who don't know what we seek -?
