moon behind cloudsfind your god,or you can't live -!the gods are waitingmotionless inflexible -the black godof the eagle is standing,his dark, closed face turned away,waiting -the red god of the snake,coiling with locked lips,ready, ready -the green godof the grass withsilent blades,awake, awake -the unseen god,watching for the blood to walk,claiming, claiming -find your god -,or you can't live -!you may worship the pale breedof the selves -,pace, begging, towards the smilingwoman o f death -- the godsare waiting,waiting -!
