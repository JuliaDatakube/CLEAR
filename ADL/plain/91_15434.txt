the thief



brother -,

the pale-dim love,

who comes to you,

when luxuriously you are spread

behind the dark-blue shield of your sleep -,

do drive her away -!






she is the queen of the pale-blooded king,

she has come,

to steal your proudest weapon -

do

drive her away -!

she has come

to empty your purpie quiver,

and give you in

her pale-blooded poison -

do drive her away -!



brother -,

if you open your lids

to her pale-dim beauty,

your eyes shall

be filled with the treacherous fog

from her glimmering womb -

do drive her away -!

when she comes through

the yielding night,

and pushes away your shield -,

remember her husband,

the king of

the slave-flogging fools -!



when she comes,

o, brother -,

her eyes will be white -

o, brother -,

do never forget

your own firm-bodied giver of pride,

your own slaving princess

of your own royal race,

though slaving to-day -!



don't forget, dearest brother -,

the power in the dark-blue shield,

given you by the bright-glowing day






of your own royal people -,

though slaving they are

to-day -!



don't forget, when she comes,

the pale-dim beguiler,

the infallible judgement

from your own royal blood,

remember

the unseen sun -!

o, brother -
