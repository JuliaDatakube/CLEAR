the song of the lonesome warrior



-man

is the one action -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -



the earth

must be loved bymen-

the wretched parts

of the futile will to be men

is stabbing

the patient heart of the earth,

crying :

"behold,we

have subdued this lazy servant -,

soon she will love us -"



soon she will die -

the last of her voice

are the remnants of man -

the earth

must be loved bymen-,

not by waiters,

and buyers

and sellers -

no part can love -,

- onlymancan love -

- you mourning remnants,

- awake -!






the reign of the seekers

is finished -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -
