spring journey- by night I left the world's house, wandered deep intomyself,leaving each door unclosed -no stars were there, no sun, no moon,I fought through barren wildernesseswith blindness lurkingon each step, with corroding poisoneating the sight of soul and body -I went still deeper -,I groped through rocky darknessinto utter void -my eyes had died,all sound had fled,the soul shrank in dread, the last,from nothingness -- I staggered deeper -and from beyond despair read with blinded eyes the tale of man's spring - carved in stone - fuller and truer - redeeming everything - like a flower -
