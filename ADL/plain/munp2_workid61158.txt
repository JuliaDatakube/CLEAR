spring balladI am the proudest of thieves -with a golden ring round my hairI sett off, when the sun sets,to steal all I want -my gliding paceis in itself the mocking unhearable fanfareof my dangerous night -I am the proudest of thieves - I despise all work,I scorn all toiling for money and food - I can love onlythe darting strength in my limbs, the unbroken growth of my beauty -with a golden ring round my hairI set off, when the sun sets,to steal what the ugly have worked -and with stolen garmentson my wonderful shoulders,when the sun just rises,I break the door of my sweet-heart -and in naked pride of my own,when the sun is treadingon the working backs of the ugly,I throw to my sweet-heartthe gleaming prey of the night -and she smiles like the queen of queens -,she is a grand thief too,the magnificent vanitywhich my sweet-heart is -I am the proudest of thieves -when the sun roars its day-song,my hair will sparkle like stolen diamondsover the world of bent backs -when the sun is singing and the day is high,my wonderful love is my own -
