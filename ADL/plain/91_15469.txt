my people



- my scattered people

is a people of haters -

and I believe

in its ragged banners

of blackness -,

loitering

like withheld storms

over this play-world

of frightened pity -

the sign of hatred

is the sign of

the will to die alive,

and not

dance in garments of love

the life of death -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

but its lips

are denying,

and its eyes are contempt -

a people who see

is forced

to hate a world who's blind -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

and its way

is the way of all haters -
