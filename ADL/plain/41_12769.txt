Urania h√¶c



When Urania, looking down from the sky, saw these earthly caves,

she said: "What new art is to be performed below the earth!"

She let herself glide down and entered. Again she spoke: "Why do I hide the stars of the sky?

Now the earth flies towards my shrine!

Here, in the depths of the earth, all that Olympus keeps to itself

is revealed. No stars can hide from these recesses.

What reason is there for the skies to be so far removed,

why do I turn the heavens with so many hidden wheels,

if lowly caverns have the power to penetrate into my lofty theatres,

and the deep earth can be the way to the stars?"
