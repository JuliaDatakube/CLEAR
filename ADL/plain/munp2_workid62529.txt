evening in the forestonly man has made himselfhis god,only the god, man, can becomeold and die -there are thousands of gods,some of which we knowsome of which we see only one timesome of which are but names -- I am not old and I am not young,I know onlythe gods of growth and birth and death,they don't speak to us, theydon't want our prayers, andsometimes I've heard them laughand sometimes weep -what do theycare about man and his angry claims,they know but growth and birth and deathwhy should we claim to be men -?- sometimes I hear my laughter answered,and sometimes my sorrow -there are thousands of gods,some of which we know -
