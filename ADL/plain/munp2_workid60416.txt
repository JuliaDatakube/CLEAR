my evening has comehere I sit -looking into my flickering firebefore me -outside the tentmy enemies are whisperingto each other -I was the victor always -I could never be conquered -they could not touch me -here I sit -the all-embracing serenityon me -always my deepest desirewas fulfilled -my success is still as clean, as new ice -I was always able to takemy soul's want -I was ableto make of my self what I wanted -,what I must -I could never be conquered -I was always the victor -here I sit -with my legs crossed, lookingwith far-off eyes into my own fire -outside the tentthe hatred goes on whispering -to night I shall be murdered -I -, the victor -,I who couldn't be conquered -my unpierceable quietude embraces everythinglike the first mother -here I sit -with my tent around me -my evening has come -
