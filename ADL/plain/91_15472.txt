evening in the forest



only man has made himself

his god,

only the god, man, can become

old and die -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know

some of which we see only one time

some of which are but names -

- I am not old and I am not young,






I know only

the gods of growth and birth and death,

they don't speak to us, they

don't want our prayers, and

sometimes I've heard them laugh

and sometimes weep -

what do they

care about man and his angry claims,

they know but growth and birth and death

why should we claim to be men -?

- sometimes I hear my laughter answered,

and sometimes my sorrow -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know -
