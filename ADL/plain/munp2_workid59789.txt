a tale about lovethere is the rock -and the steel-bright, averted face -but there isthe little door too -and there ismy blood-red heartburning on its golden foot -but youknock at the stone,and youpromise to wait one hundred yearsfor the eyes to turn -and youcry your life to ragsbecause my heartis a flame on its golden foot -there was the rock -and the closed, blind face -but there wasthe little door too -and youare nothing to me -
