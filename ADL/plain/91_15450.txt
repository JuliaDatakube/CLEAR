the certainty



the radiant outskirts

of the land which is real

gleam forth -

in the land which is real

I have my friend -

there we shall touch

the simple nakedness

of each other -,

my friend and I -



four is the sacred number

in the land which is real -

my friend and his woman,

I and my woman,






in the holy grove

there are the four trees

of our common silence -



I have caught a glimpse

of the land which is real -

nothing

shall turn my pace -
