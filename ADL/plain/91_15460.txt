spring ballad



I am the proudest of thieves -

with a golden ring round my hair

I sett off, when the sun sets,

to steal all I want -

my gliding pace

is in itself the mocking unhearable fanfare

of my dangerous night -



I am the proudest of thieves -

I despise all work,






I scorn all toiling for money and food -

I can love only

the darting strength in my limbs,

the unbroken growth of my beauty -



with a golden ring round my hair

I set off, when the sun sets,

to steal what the ugly have worked -

and with stolen garments

on my wonderful shoulders,

when the sun just rises,

I break the door of my sweet-heart -



and in naked pride of my own,

when the sun is treading

on the working backs of the ugly,

I throw to my sweet-heart

the gleaming prey of the night -

and she smiles like the queen of queens -,

she is a grand thief too,

the magnificent vanity

which my sweet-heart is -



I am the proudest of thieves -

when the sun roars its day-song,

my hair will sparkle like stolen diamonds

over the world of bent backs -

when the sun is singing and the day is high,

my wonderful love is my own -
