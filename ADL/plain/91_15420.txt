the special miracle



every night he was tired,

and every day he did as he was told -

and without alarm

he grew thirty years old -

and rather alone -



then one night he was not sleepy,

and that night he thought,

that something

might happen to him -

especially -



and early in the morning

he stole five pounds,

and got together with a woman, he knew,

rather drunk -

the day, the night and the next day -



and late in the evening

he got caught -

quietly, without alarm -

and after a time came back -

but oh -!



every night he slept,

and by day he did as he was told -

and together with the woman, he knew,

he quietly grew sixty

years old -

when speaking of life,

he smiled -
