in the glademy fatehas no shadowsno homeand no friendly lake -no whispering treesand no female moon -my fatehas no poemsno caressing fire,and my way hasno polished end at last -- you thinkme the waiting poet -I am not -my fate shall not change -I shall nevercontrol my hissing voice -I shallnever bring to my peopletied-up the broad-scaled fish of wisdom -my peopleshall never lift from my handsthe glowing gifts of my god -never shall I leave the forests,my fate shall never roar from the lustrious spiresof clearness -my fate shall not change -I am the dark-faced hunter,I am hunting the arrowsfrom the unseen suns -,I am hunting the coiling cuesfrom the waiting earth -I throw my prey on the waters -for the sharp-eyed to catch,for the able to sow -don't send your beggars to me -,my mercy is gone -don't send your rulers to me -,my humbleness is gone -if they come, the begging rulers,I'll take them to the Stone in the gladeand betray them there -if my fettered brothersdo seek me deep in the forest,I'll  show  themthe craving of their re-born God -,I will lend themmy eye and my spear -but my dearest preyI have thrown on the waters,to feed my children -I am the dark-faced hunter,I throw my gold on the waters -
