slave -!



your murmuring soul

calls me

the snake-man and the whip of cruelty -,

your sneering lips

are chewing

the fettered shouts:

tormenter on his self-made throne of haughtiness -,

oppresser with his lifted spear

of un-sharpened death -!



the film of your sight

is the skin of the slave

which is you -



tenderness is weeping

deep in my soul, unused -,

but not for you -

hungering love is awake

for ever in the veins of my covered limbs -,

but not for you -



your race, it is,

who makes me

an imprisoned ruler

and blackens the naked face

of my glory of life -

your race, it is,

who forces me

to make a merciless sword

of my free-born soul -

your race, it is,

slave -

- the hating barrenness

behind the eyelids of yours and your numerous breed

is distasteful to me -

do

leave me alone -
