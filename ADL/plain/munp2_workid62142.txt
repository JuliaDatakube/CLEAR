my people- my scattered people is a people of haters - and I believein its ragged bannersof blackness -,loiteringlike withheld stormsover this play-worldof frightened pity -the sign of hatredis the sign ofthe will to die alive,and notdance in garments of lovethe life of death -- my scattered people is the people of love - but its lipsare denying,and its eyes are contempt -a people who seeis forcedto hate a world who's blind -- my scattered people is the people of love - and its wayis the way of all haters -
