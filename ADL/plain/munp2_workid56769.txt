modest love-tuneah -, I've found something -!ah -, I love my flesh and my bones -and my sweat and my marrow bones -my body does giveme, what I want -,my body denies me,what I shouldn't want -my body is no female body, my body is not a price to be paid for anything -my body is no worker,my body isn't no handleof any machine -and not the servantof any prayer -my body is me,ah -, I love you, my shoulders, my knees -!I do feel wellin your company -,you can't be flattered,it is done -,I can't be touched,when I am with you -,I'm glad, I've caught you at last,you -,me -!
