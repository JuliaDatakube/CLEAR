song



I have no need of women,

why should I

why should you -?

I have no need of men,

why should I

why should you -?

- sometimes I want to love,

then I set off

far away, or not far,

for where love is -

why should I

why should you -?

it is fine to seek what you want,

fine to wander far or not far,

to seek what you want,

it is fine to be always proud -

why should I

why should you -?
