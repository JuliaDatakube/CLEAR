the song of the black banner



try not

to rebuild the white-soaring swan

of freedom

of equality

on the soil of snapping dogs -

she'll be

the easy prey to their

dripping hunger -,

the sneaking bitches

and the cringing dogs -






there is no freedom

there is no equality

not too

frail, not to crumble

beneath their stinking love

and their rat-like joy -,

the dogs -



there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the icy loneliness of the sailing eagle

the meeting bitterness of the real lovers

the forc√©d closedness of the god-born ruler -

there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the silent community

of the aristocrats of the Blood -

there is one sign of freedom

and one sign of equality

one only -:

the irresistible voice

from the god-eye of Blood

on the purified brow of its man -
