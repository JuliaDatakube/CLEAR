early morning(to carmelo)



my infinite world is

in the closed egg of my will towards god -



every finished piece

of joy and clean bitterness

is put aside on the deep bottom of the sacred eye -



always has god's heat been over me and

shall always be till perfection breaks through

the vast forest of my world -






his face is of no use for my timefilling work -

at some close or approaching time

the egg of my world will open,



my work shall stop -,

and eternal repeating of that single act of god,

which is me,

shall be the sign that my will may go -
