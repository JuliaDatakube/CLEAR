the weapon



hunger has left me -

love has left me -

longing for events is not with me -

misfortune has found me out -



but joy cannot slay -,

and the love, you find, cannot slay -,

if I held a weapon, that

could hit by itself -!

but hunger has left me -

and love has left me -






no longing is with me now -

it must come by itself -

or stay away -

the green, the warm,

the weapon,

which need not hit -
