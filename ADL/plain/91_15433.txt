in the glade



my fate

has no shadows

no home

and no friendly lake -

no whispering trees

and no female moon -

my fate

has no poems

no caressing fire,

and my way has

no polished end at last -

- you think

me the waiting poet -

I am not -



my fate shall not change -

I shall never

control my hissing voice -

I shall

never bring to my people

tied-up the broad-scaled fish of wisdom -

my people

shall never lift from my hands

the glowing gifts of my god -

never shall I leave the forests,

my fate shall never roar from the lustrious spires

of clearness -

my fate shall not change -






I am the dark-faced hunter,

I am hunting the arrows

from the unseen suns -,

I am hunting the coiling cues

from the waiting earth -

I throw my prey on the waters -

for the sharp-eyed to catch,

for the able to sow -

don't send your beggars to me -,

my mercy is gone -

don't send your rulers to me -,

my humbleness is gone -

if they come, the begging rulers,

I'll take them to the Stone in the glade

and betray them there -

if my fettered brothers

do seek me deep in the forest,

I'll show them

the craving of their re-born God -,

I will lend them

my eye and my spear -



but my dearest prey

I have thrown on the waters,

to feed my children -

I am the dark-faced hunter,

I throw my gold on the waters -
