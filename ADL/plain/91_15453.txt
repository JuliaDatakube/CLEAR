the stone



all, I give respect,

in my self,

I have cut off

from my life -



all, I have loved,

in my eyes -,

in my heart -,

in my hands -,

I have cut off from my life -



all, that was creative

and strong in my blood,

I have locked up

in this unhewn stone -

all, that was generous

and soft in my blood,

I have locked up

in this stone on the shore -



all, I have won

by now,






is the undeceivable contempt,

which from now on

shall be my soul

and the only guard

of the key to this stone -



but always

the key will be ready -!

thence the holiness of my pride -,

thence the joy in my smile of anger -,

thence

all the unworthy remains,

I have given my idleness to play with -
