song of the council



the name of our

wisdom is wine and dance

and silence -

the name of the great hunger

is the same -

the goddess of wisdom

is always alone,

and always drunk

and always she feels

the far-off rhythm of the unknown

teasing her pride, binding

her tongue, releasing

the voices of her listening blood -

we'll protect her aloneness

and shield her silence,

her words do creep strange ways -
