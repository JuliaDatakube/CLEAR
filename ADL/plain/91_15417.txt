at the bottom



nobody knows what he wants -

the good are timid -,

the strong are devils -,

the wise are barren -,

the fertile seduced

to geld their fruits -

- where are you,

where are you tenderness, certainty -?

where

are you hiding -,

where do you hide -,

in readiness for

us who don't know what we seek -?


sleeping murmur



dark bosom of mine -

god has taken his seat

in my dark bosom -

o world, let god live -

o world -



the voice, against which

I always have to listen,

the voice is telling me, incessantly

that a world of burning secrets

is to find

there

there in the deep, where

god has pleased to crouch

in the soft silence

of life -







people of the world,

I want to death, that

you should long towards

the dark spreading deep,

towards the dark unknown soil

in the bosom of mine -

people of the world,

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark unknown bosom of mine -



god is nourishing on

my joy and my sorrow -

people of the world,

I beseech you, give

to me an eternal life -!

people of the world,

let god live -!

people of the world,

forget yourself, and give

your children to drink the milk of the sun,

the innumerable secrets

of the fire, and god's heart

of lust -



people of the world -!

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark bosom of mine -

forget yourself and

give to your children

thefulfilling,

eternally waiting deep, where

god crouches in

waiting silence of life -






the special miracle



every night he was tired,

and every day he did as he was told -

and without alarm

he grew thirty years old -

and rather alone -



then one night he was not sleepy,

and that night he thought,

that something

might happen to him -

especially -



and early in the morning

he stole five pounds,

and got together with a woman, he knew,

rather drunk -

the day, the night and the next day -



and late in the evening

he got caught -

quietly, without alarm -

and after a time came back -

but oh -!



every night he slept,

and by day he did as he was told -

and together with the woman, he knew,

he quietly grew sixty

years old -

when speaking of life,

he smiled -


the song of the useless



no wine don't help

nothing -

we have tried that too -







its gentleness is not

cruel enough -

there is nothing untried

to us -

don't wait

for notcoming cure -!

rather take all your

defects and hold forth

as ugly and

disgusting, as you ever can -,

the quite whole of

your scanty defects -

perhaps it'll help -

no wine in the world

really don't help

nothing -



we are quite a lot of us,

we will go all over the world

carrying an enormous banner

of disgusting rottenness

with us - who can tell,

perhaps it'll help -

we are quite a lot -

and no wine

will never help -

what we

have got, is not very enticing -

don't hide it away -!

do show it

high over the world

as a banner of future,

mightier than

oppressive beauty -!

perhaps it shall

be able

to kill all lying happiness

with sound disgust -






the castle



the eyes of my longing have grown impatient -

my longing claims irresistably

its fulfilling -

and me, the waiting dreamer,

she has forced to work -



my longing has declared everyone her enemy -

the burning swords of the sun

have become her slaves -

the silent cows of the moon

have become her slaves too -

irresistable my longing

has declared everything her enemy -

and of me, the patient lover of glory,

she has made a slave -



between the two rivers,

all around

the free country of my glory

is being raised a towering castle,

and no light nor sound

is to be let in -

I, the idling waster of happiness,

have been made a slave -

towards heaven

the castle is rising -,

in the dirt is bent the face of my glory -

towards heaven the walls are rising -

impregnable the walls

of my prison are rising -

in the tower am I -

no light nor sound

from my glory is let in -



my longing has grown impatient,

my longing claims its fulfilling -

in the tower she is coming to see me -

- she claims, what is hers -






the artist's vision




I know

everything -

I have payed

everything -




there is no

heart -

there is no

sun -

there is no

life -



there is

the god of hardness -

there is

the goddess of stone -

there is

the ice of my will -


wind



my love is the merciless killer -

my love is sailing in blood -

my love can only subdue -

my love can't like the subdued -

my love doesn't want no more blood -



on the rock

the far-off eyes of the albatross

is waiting -

the reef

is not the last -

the goal is one only -

that is

what the wind must bring -

soon -

the wind only

is eternal -






portrait



when sleeping

I seek my princess -,



in the morning

I break all the flowers -,



in the sun

I build my aloneness -,



towards night

I carve out the future -,



my life I spare -

my death

shall never exist -


the god of the blood(1 song)



I have given over

the gods of 1935 -

I have given over

the god of pleasure

with thegildedhands

and the green face -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have given over

the god of comfort

with the murmuring anxiety

and the rotten love-hands -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have known

the god of the bread,

the blind warrior -







he gave the bread

and the hunger for bread,

he said: "I know you not" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have fought

the god of happiness,

the soft-shouldered -

he gave what he had,

but he died on my sword -

he whispered: "I hate you" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -!

he gave me nothing -,

he said: "I have but

the cruelty which is truth -,

I have but the aloneness,

which is the way -,

I have but the place,

where to wait

with ice on your life -,

myhand is no giver -,

myhand is the unbroken law -.

I am the god of the blood" -

- I have gone -,

and my lips are locked -

l have gone -,

I have touched the flame,

which leaves no ashes

and no love to man nor woman -


the god of the blood(2 song)




the old gods are dead,

the old humanities are dead -

the old priests are liars -








the women of the old

are wicked with no soul in their blood -,

the men of the old

are beggars with no will in their blood -

the white blood of the old

is the world's poison

and the dragon before the world's treasures -



I am alone,

I have found no mate,

I am a half,

I am proud,

but I am nothing yet,

l obey and I wait,

and I hide my sword -



I know, the god of goodness

is dead -,

died in his own onliness -

his timidity devoured him

unborn -

I know, the god of goodness

has nothing left -,

owns nothing himself -,

has nothing to give -



I know, the goddess of love

is mouldering away,

withering deep in her own barrenness -

her wine was a sterile fire,

her goldenness an evil shade -

I know, the impoverished goddess of love

has nothing left -

her withered limbs have no heat left

to warm her age -

she has nothing to give -









you dark god

behind -, underneath -!

you severe god,

with black face

and the blood-red hands

and the silent eyes

and the streaming, unhearable voice -,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who held forth the others,

the weak ones, the pale and the powerless,

which are now dead,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who exerts your power without man's devotion,

you who knows our names,

which we cannot see ourselves -,

show us your face -!

kill the dying powerless gods

from the lost humanities -,

do free us from the nonpotent ashes

of bewildered man -!



in the cleaving paws of the night,

on the white at the bottom of the blood-proud sun,

behind the potent helmet of the gathering moon

I hear the voice -, streaming -

I hear,

and I obey -



but your name,

I want your face,

you with the two streams of life

in your right hand -

and the two black feathers of death

in your left hand,

I want your face,

your name -!








you, the only god -,

you, who was always behind,

underneath -, you who let die

the revengeful jehovah and the allforgiving christ,

you, who has destroyed the joyous realm of mammon,

stand out,

show us your hands -!

we are waiting -,

to obey -

we know, we are nothing apart from you,

give us back the old faculties

from before the reign of man,

give us back our righteous names -,

and our righteous piaces,

give to our men the will towards you,

which is all will,

and the only -,

give to our women the longing for you,

which is all longing -,

and the only -

give to the earth

and the sun and moon

the proportion which is you,

and you only -

we claim everything from you,

we have robbed ourselves of everything -!



o, we know that happiness is not in

youreye,

we know that blessed love is not in

yourcrown -,

we have caught your streaming voice

from far-off -!

we wantyoursway upon our blood,

we wantreality, which is you,

we want the right,

not love nor joy,

youare our want,








youto come inourhands, our eyes,

youto wander, swaying, throughourveins -

we know you,

o, we know you,

you black god of rightness -,

do crush our earth between

the fingers of your right hand -,

let come forth the marrow of our ill-used earth,

still waiting -

we, the last men and women of this earth,

we beg you to take our nakedness and

rule us again -!

o, black god, we beg you to give us back your severity

over our crippled blood,

we beg of you, o god,

nothing but the sight of your two hands -,

the two streams of life

and the black feathers of death,

we want your sword to wander among us

as before the reign of man -



we men of god,

we won't be reigned by anointedmen,

we, the men of god,

we want back our righteous chief -

- the men of god do wantyou

god -!


the mother's death




my mother parted

the string of the universe from me,

bearing me a closed person,

but she left the string

of intention, her person's pride -



with the string

of herwombround my neck








I went,

would create the growth of the star

with my young man's fingers -

round my neck the intention

of person -



I ran to my woman,

I pulled at the string unknowingly

with my young blood -

I ran to my woman,

the string of the unfreed flesh

round my blood -



I would give the star

with my soul,

and I wanted my body

to be given me -

my poverty

the poverty of the unborn -



I parted my blood

from my flesh and I ran

to my woman -

I gave with my soul,

and I stole with my flesh,

and my blood was behind

silent -



I tore the soul of my woman,

I gave her my soul away

and failed -

and wept, the string

round my neck, proud

as ice -




I have killed my mother -

I hear the stream -, the ice

is thrown over -








I am black as blood,

I am silent as

sun and moon together,

my voice swept away with the broken ice -



I hear the stream of creation,

not mine, not yours, not hers -

I have killed my mother -

my soul stands upright in the flood

like anotterodder -

the star is soft as silver

down in the flood -



my face is finished,

and the tree of sleep

is waiting -

the stream is silent -

my tongue stands vibrating

in the dead heart

of the angry intentions of

all persons -



the stream of creation

is climbing onunheedingpaws

towards me -

my face is closed round itself

like the jaws of life -


moon behind clouds



find your god,

or you can't live -!

the gods are waiting

motionless inflexible -

the black god

of the eagle is standing,

his dark, closed face turned away,

waiting -







the red god of the snake,

coiling with locked lips,

ready, ready -

the green god

of the grass with

silent blades,

awake, awake -

the unseen god,

watching for the blood to walk,

claiming, claiming -

find your god -,

or you can't live -!



you may worship the pale breed

of the selves -,

pace, begging, towards the smiling

woman o f death -

- the gods

are waiting,

waiting -!


rejected



sadness is

in my veins,

anger has filled my eyes,

my lips are dry with ashes -



my goodwill has turned to hatred,

my hope is an unworthy slave,

but my sight is clean as a spear,

and I see,

and I know,

o, I know,

the people of mine has refused

myservice -!







the people of mine

is happy -

but its prayers

are humble -

the world won't give

my people more money -!

the women can't give

the men no more pride -!

my people is happy -,

but my people is praying -



my people is licking its own holy corpse,

is biting in worship and hopeful resentment

the sacred parts -,

my countrymen don't like their devoted servant,

they cry -:

who are you,

to profaneourcandid devotion,

who areyou,

to call down the anger

of god 'pon the heads of your worshipping people -!



- my lips are dry with ashes -

I know why -


modest love-tune



ah -, I've found something -!

ah -, I love my flesh and my bones -

and my sweat and my marrow bones -

my body does give

me, what I want -,

my body denies me,

what I shouldn't want -



my body is no female body,

my body is not a price

to be paid for anything -







my body is no worker,

my body isn't no handle

of any machine -

and not the servant

of any prayer -

my body is me,

ah -, I love you, my shoulders, my knees -!



I do feel well

inyourcompany -,

you can't be flattered,

it is done -,

I can't be touched,

when I am with you -,

I'm glad, I've caught you at last,

you-,

me -!


good-bye




you are my friend -, but

don't let yourself be fooled

by the fair skin on my face,

don't believe

in the sky-blue ring round my pupils -



my friend -, yes -,

but you shouldn't

trust me that

open way of yours with the sad, kind smile -,

one day -, my friend,

you shall not know me,

one day you shall not know

me,

the born hater of what you love -



my friend -, with the outstretched hands,

my friend,








do turn your eye away

frommyhand,

always waiting, always awake -

my friend,

you know me not,

you have never seen me,

don't call me your friend,

I amnone,

can't be,

I hate you,

I must -,

turn away your eye -!

from me -



my friend -,

go -!

be aware -:

mysoul is not light

as yours -,

myblood is not

like the petals of roses -,

like yours -

the gloomy red of the sudden night,

that'smysoul -

the darting black on the puma's flank

does crouch inmyveins,

the inflexible jet on the stone of death,

that'smyblood -



my friend be aware -!

you must -

you are my enemy,

I can never know you -

my eyes despise

yourwomen -

my brow despises

yourclamorous love -,

youlaugh








atmysharpened silence -

- your garden, young man,

is filled with flowers,

the songs from your lips

are cunning, and the buds

will open -,

but your sight shall for ever

be hazy from love -, and never you shall know,

from what soil your songs did rise -



young man,

I must leave you,

for ever your people should mistrust me,

for ever, at your side,

I should be a stranger in every country -,

never

amongst your people I would find my righteous mate -




young man,

I must leave you -

mygathering race

shall never be strong

at peace withyours-

- the world was conquered by the pale-blooded -,

for centuries my race has been slaving -

but the slaves begot kings,

and the kings did slave, and their children,

for centuries -

the pale people forgot the law of their own gods -

they have lost the secret,

that gave the world to their sway -

the people of the pale has lost their hands -



but the god of my race has returned

from the bath of death -

- good-bye -!

I hear the call -








- the god of silence

with the will of the sun on his brow

has sent the spear of war

to me

his man -


in the glade



my fate

has no shadows

no home

and no friendly lake -

no whispering trees

and no female moon -

my fate

has no poems

no caressing fire,

and my way has

no polished end at last -

- you think

me the waiting poet -

I am not -



my fate shall not change -

I shall never

control my hissing voice -

I shall

never bring to my people

tied-up the broad-scaled fish of wisdom -

my people

shall never lift from my hands

the glowing gifts of my god -

never shall I leave the forests,

my fate shall never roar from the lustrious spires

of clearness -

my fate shall not change -







I am the dark-faced hunter,

I am hunting the arrows

from the unseen suns -,

I am hunting the coiling cues

from the waiting earth -

I throw my prey on the waters -

for the sharp-eyed to catch,

for the able to sow -

don't send your beggars to me -,

my mercy is gone -

don't send your rulers to me -,

my humbleness is gone -

if they come, the begging rulers,

I'll take them to the Stone in the glade

and betray them there -

if my fettered brothers

do seek me deep in the forest,

I'll show them

the craving of their re-born God -,

I will lend them

my eye and my spear -



but my dearest prey

I have thrown on the waters,

to feed my children -

I am the dark-faced hunter,

I throw my gold on the waters -


the thief



brother -,

the pale-dim love,

who comes to you,

when luxuriously you are spread

behind the dark-blue shield of your sleep -,

do drive her away -!







she is the queen of the pale-blooded king,

she has come,

to steal your proudest weapon -

do

drive her away -!

she has come

to empty your purpie quiver,

and give you in

her pale-blooded poison -

do drive her away -!



brother -,

if you open your lids

to her pale-dim beauty,

your eyes shall

be filled with the treacherous fog

from her glimmering womb -

do drive her away -!

when she comes through

the yielding night,

and pushes away your shield -,

remember her husband,

the king of

the slave-flogging fools -!



when she comes,

o, brother -,

her eyes will be white -

o, brother -,

do never forget

your own firm-bodied giver of pride,

your own slaving princess

of your own royal race,

though slaving to-day -!



don't forget, dearest brother -,

the power in the dark-blue shield,

given you by the bright-glowing day







of your own royal people -,

though slaving they are

to-day -!



don't forget, when she comes,

the pale-dim beguiler,

the infallible judgement

from your own royal blood,

remember

the unseen sun -!

o, brother -


to my woman



don't speak to me yet -,

I can't listen -

don't look at me yet -,

I can't meet you -

you who have the right

don't touch me -

yet my skin is not bright -



I

have no right yet -,

I

am not allowed yet

to take my right -

I have liked

thepale-browedwomen of the enemy -

don't claim no tenderness

from me -

I gave it to them,

that was all they could take -

don't claim no strenght

from me -

that was what they wanted -







don't mention to me

my name -

don't mention to me

myrighteouspower -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -

the will of my blood

has returned to the lake of our dead,

to wash from its heart the pale-blooded hatred -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -

whisper



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your hand,

your slim, patient hand -,

I want to touch your fingers -,

to watch your pale-brown face

turn -



my heart is a knot

of ill-treated scars

in my tight-screwed fist -

pale-brown girl,

I am afraid of every movement -

your soft, black eyes

do graze my brow -

will you heal me -?

can you -?



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your fingers -

I am afraid of every movement -

let your sad, black eyes

rest on my brow -

I have no tears,

and my strength has gone -






to my dancing-partner



we are

the real action,

we are

together,

we are

the Dance -



you are

my perfect instrument,

I am

your perfect voice,

we play what we

do know,

we are

the instrument to play

what there is to know -



I love

your heart in my bow -

you love

my blood in your song -

together

we carve out a star -,

together

we make a new life -

we are

the real action,

we are

the Dance -


verse



I wanted to love,

rage came to me -

I wanted to hate,

everything weakened -







I wanted to leave,

there came

a sad-eyed girl, she took my hand,

I slept -

I have not risen -


the song of the lonesome warrior



-man

is the one action -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -



the earth

must be loved bymen-

the wretched parts

of the futile will to be men

is stabbing

the patient heart of the earth,

crying :

"behold,we

have subdued this lazy servant -,

soon she will love us -"



soon she will die -

the last of her voice

are the remnants of man -

the earth

must be loved bymen-,

not by waiters,

and buyers

and sellers -

no part can love -,

- onlymancan love -

- you mourning remnants,

- awake -!







the reign of the seekers

is finished -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -


the voice of the man



don't seek my eyes -

I am afraid of every contact -

I am afraid

of the desire to rule

deep in the soul of my hand -

I am afraid of the fetters,

which my eyes do put on everything -

don't touch me -,

I hate obeyance -,

I hate the clinging love of the dreamers

don't seek my eyes -,

I am no phantom -,

I am no seeker -

don't touch me -



I am nothing but fate -

I am afraid of every contact -

my hand shall take what it must -

don't touch me -

my eyes don't seek -


now I know you



now

I know you -

you have betrayed me -

your arms were warm







but your heart was white

and poor as steel -



now

I know you -

you have used me -

you wanted to sell

my will -

but do know -:

your prey shall be

the snake of my

righteous anger -,

when your feet will turn

down the path towards the market

of my enemies,

you'll have but the poverty

of yourself to sell -



do know -:

your own people you can't deceive -,

they

know your want,theyfeel

your naked soul in their hands -



now

I know you -

when smiling

into my enemies' faces,

your prey

shall be the unstained dagger

of the upright purity which you

could not love,

when you feel

the coins of your price

in the hands of your cunning,

in that moment, betrayer,

you'll have upon

your adorable neck the rising power,







you couldn't conquer -

you'll know,

that offering lips can be wounded,

the law

of the blood has never

been broken -



I know you -

be safe -,

youhave nothing to lose -

you

have betrayed,

but the will

you could rob of nothing -


the smile



you old woman

with the cutting sparks

behind the slow glance -,

with lips as a slash in a lonely fir -,

with teeth as lurking anger -,

ah you -!

ah you -, you -!



I'll drive you

slowly, slowly towards the immovable precipice -,

I'll laugh at your sneering retreat -,

I'll snap at your lingering heel,

you wicked love-hater -,

I'll crush your sunken bosom,

and

on the outmost brink

I'll bite your murderous joy,

I'll love you to ripeness hard as flint -,

you -, ah

you -, dear -!






my prayer



o god -,

o god -,

my sight will turn hazy -!



the limping,

out-reaching fear

does break the purity

of creative rhythm -,

the worshipping falsity

of hopeless fear

does lock the ears

to the resounding power

of creative pride -



god, give me

the forcing translation

of the urge in the storm,

of the voice in the rising sun -,

give me

the binding power,

that ropes-in the many,

that forces the frightened

into the rhythm

of creative will -



god, show me

the name of my mate,

the only -,

that, like a column of blood, my tree

may stand out -

god,

this is my prayer -


proposal



this is me -

this is, what I

demand







from the mate,

which is to be mine -:



when she is near me,

we shall be born from god -,

when I am with her,

we shall beget the prince,

for whom the world is waiting -



when I leave her,

to risk my life with my icy fate,

her pride shall conquer

easily her womb -



when I beg her to heal

my tired-to-death despair,

she,

with steel-hard courage,

shall show me again and again

the way which may hold out

the destruction of me,

her man -

her eye

shall be the merciless

killer of my will to die -

her foot

shall be the burning sceptre

to my victorious joy -

her life

shall be the voice

of my blood -

I shall call her

my woman -


hunting-song




I am no human -

the pace of my blood

is alien to all that is human -








I despise the ready-made limits and

the mercy from fear,

I hate themoulderingseparatenes

and thegeldedmass-will

of the human -



I am no human -

I adore my forcing desire

to destroy the want to build monuments

to strangle the insane need to rule

the detestable lust ofsubmission,

to stab the hateful want

to glorify all dying -



I am no human -

I am blind to

the greatness of mankind

except the black nerve

deep through the flesh of all living -

I have no faith

in the future of mankind

except in

the burning rhythm

quiveringmerciless

through the will of all living -



I am no human -

my cat-soft soul

is always on guard to shun

the track of all human -

the scent of my blood

is hostile to all that is human -

but -, alas -, I love

the dance in every foot of life,

o, I love

the song in the eyes of every fire,

and -, alas -, I can't but

bow in the dust








to each hand of creation

and everywombof love -




I am no human -

the raving dread

of all that is human

had driven me

step by step

deep into the forests of hatred -

but now I have triumphed -,

my voice has forgotten all words -,

my love

has made the forests my home -

I have found the fire

of my own rock -,

I have acknowledged

my seed of future -

at last -


brother -!



don't fight

your own silent will -

don't build barriers

on the only way of your soul -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

bright behind the shabby clothes

of the un-real -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

waiting, ready

to stand out







free and strong

to its own brightness -



don't fight

your own silent will -

stand out

naked to your own soul -

pull off

the contaminated rags

of imperious death-will -,

leave behind you

the strangling chain of the dread

of life uncovered -



do walk

silent the way of your deepest being -

nothing there is

to change -

the will

of the sun and the unconquerable blood

is you too -


the message of the chief



when you open

towards night or day

the shield-like tent-door

of your fate, calling:

I am this, I am that,

my need is all or nothing

or -:

mypride is not dependant

on neither joy nor shelter -!

when calling

towards night or day,

don't think you are god,

don't expect

your voice to fill







the gaping cup of your life -!

you are calling -,

that's all -

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the protective door

of your life-tent -

don't whisper,

in claiming rage:

I am this, I am that,

myneed is the need of a king

or that of a slave -!

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the saving door

of your life-tent -

do keep holy

the untranslatable sign of your blood

on the brow of yours -

do preserve

as your only treasure

the waiting silence

of your upright will -



don't send

your claiming calls

towards night nor day -

the answer

will come -


a tale about love



there is the rock -

and the steel-bright, averted face -

but there is







the little door too -

and there is

my blood-red heart

burning on its golden foot -



but you

knock at the stone,

and you

promise to wait one hundred years

for the eyes to turn -

and you

cry your life to rags

because my heart

is a flame on its golden foot -



there was the rock -

and the closed, blind face -

but there was

the little door too -

and you

are nothing to me -


the certainty



the radiant outskirts

of the land which is real

gleam forth -

in the land which is real

I have my friend -

there we shall touch

the simple nakedness

of each other -,

my friend and I -



four is the sacred number

in the land which is real -

my friend and his woman,

I and my woman,







in the holy grove

there are the four trees

of our common silence -



I have caught a glimpse

of the land which is real -

nothing

shall turn my pace -


the ruler



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

my wealth has no limits -,

and my cruelty neither -

nothing can hinder

the growth of my power -,

not even the steel-hard grasp

of my dark-blue hand

can direct

the fall of corroding drops

from my jet-black star -

I am the ruler -

but the unchecked growth of my power

is threatening even the ground

of the deep-bolted f eet of my soul -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

but my eyes are tired

of condemning

what has always been dead -,

and my eyes can't like

what they themselves have created -

I am the ruler -

but my neck is tired

of its own inflexible pride -

my heart of blood

is tired of kissing what it has born itself -







I am the ruler -

but I say -:

I would break my unshaken crown

to get love

not created by me -,

I would give my invincible power

to get love,

whose fire could feed itself -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

I want to be robbed of my riches -,

I am tired of giving

my presents of fate -

I am the ruler -

I want my strength to forsake me -,

and my lust of creation -

there is too much blood in my eyes -,

and too much murdering purity

has left my hand already -



I am the ruler -

but my crown is stronger than I -

I am the ruler -

but my power has beaten my will -

the ring of my crown is unbroken -


the gull



- this rock

is my place -

my eyes

are setting off on low wings

from this rock -

- this sea

is my life -

my eyes

are hovering on motionless wings

over this sea -







- my eyes

can grip only the far-off -

my eyes know no short distances -

- my eyes

have no colour to change -

my eyes are indifference to everything -

my eyes remember nothing but their unseen aim -

- my eyes

don't wait for anybody to rise -

my eyes know their place and their life -:

this rock -

this sea -

- everything else is dead unto my eyes -


the stone



all, I give respect,

in my self,

I have cut off

from my life -



all, I have loved,

in my eyes -,

in my heart -,

in my hands -,

I have cut off from my life -



all, that was creative

and strong in my blood,

I have locked up

in this unhewn stone -

all, that was generous

and soft in my blood,

I have locked up

in this stone on the shore -



all, I have won

by now,







is the undeceivable contempt,

which from now on

shall be my soul

and the only guard

of the key to this stone -



but always

the key will be ready -!

thence the holiness of my pride -,

thence the joy in my smile of anger -,

thence

all the unworthy remains,

I have given my idleness to play with -


my evening has come



here I sit -

looking into my flickering fire

before me -

outside the tent

my enemies are whispering

to each other -

I was the victor always -

I could never be conquered -

they could not touch me -



here I sit -

the all-embracing serenity

on me -

always my deepest desire

was fulfilled -

my success is still as clean, as new ice -

I was always able to take

my soul's want -

I was able

to make of my self what I wanted -,

what I must -







I could never be conquered -

I was always the victor -

here I sit -

with my legs crossed, looking

with far-off eyes into my own fire -

outside the tent

the hatred goes on whispering -

to night I shall be murdered -

I -, the victor -,

I who couldn't be conquered -

my unpierceable quietude embraces everything

like the first mother -

here I sit -

with my tent around me -

my evening has come -


hymn



the house of my certainty

is so vast

that I never can touch its walls -



the room of my deepest desire

is so sacred

that none but my friend and my woman

can be permitted to enter -



the tower of my watchman's eye

is so high

that the fall of my death

never can reach

the aim of my fear -



the sword of my pride

is so hard

that never the corroding impurity

assembled from all the world

can stain its brightness -







to every upright soul in distress

the house of my certainty

is open -

to every fighting will of blood

my gleaming eye

is the unfailing sign of victory,

of inexhaustible rest -

to every succumbing purity

the garden of my healing love

is prepared

with unvanquished tenderness -



the house of my certainty

is nobody's property -

I

am the ever-watching opener

of its silent gate -


melody



she came to me

with flashing eyes

and thrown-back hair

commanding -:

I am the princess -



I made her

the begging fire

the kneeling eye

whispering -:

you are my ruler -



she left me

with silent eyes

and inflexible brow

to wander

the painful way of a princess -






slave -!



your murmuring soul

calls me

the snake-man and the whip of cruelty -,

your sneering lips

are chewing

the fettered shouts:

tormenter on his self-made throne of haughtiness -,

oppresser with his lifted spear

of un-sharpened death -!



the film of your sight

is the skin of the slave

which is you -



tenderness is weeping

deep in my soul, unused -,

but not for you -

hungering love is awake

for ever in the veins of my covered limbs -,

but not for you -



your race, it is,

who makes me

an imprisoned ruler

and blackens the naked face

of my glory of life -

your race, it is,

who forces me

to make a merciless sword

of my free-born soul -

your race, it is,

slave -

- the hating barrenness

behind the eyelids of yours and your numerous breed

is distasteful to me -

do

leave me alone -






the foreboding



the glowing stone of nobility

is the eye -

through the jet-bright gate

of the eye goes

the irresistible stream

of the male-ruler's straight command -,

piercing merciless

the shells of poisoned resistance -

through the soft-opening mouth

of the eye does

the forcing-creative stream of submission

penetrate unheeding -

the new nobility,

which is to save the world's

heart and womb

to man,

is older than the died-away

nobility that failed -

the new nobility

must have

both the black blood-silent origin and

the tenderly redeeming future

in its eye -,

the glowing stone of all nobility -


the song of the black banner



try not

to rebuild the white-soaring swan

of freedom

of equality

on the soil of snapping dogs -

she'll be

the easy prey to their

dripping hunger -,

the sneaking bitches

and the cringing dogs -







there is no freedom

there is no equality

not too

frail, not to crumble

beneath their stinking love

and their rat-like joy -,

the dogs -



there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the icy loneliness of the sailing eagle

the meeting bitterness of the real lovers

the forcéd closedness of the god-born ruler -

there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the silent community

of the aristocrats of the Blood -

there is one sign of freedom

and one sign of equality

one only -:

the irresistible voice

from the god-eye of Blood

on the purified brow of its man -


spring ballad



I am the proudest of thieves -

with a golden ring round my hair

I sett off, when the sun sets,

to steal all I want -

my gliding pace

is in itself the mocking unhearable fanfare

of my dangerous night -



I am the proudest of thieves -

I despise all work,







I scorn all toiling for money and food -

I can love only

the darting strength in my limbs,

the unbroken growth of my beauty -



with a golden ring round my hair

I set off, when the sun sets,

to steal what the ugly have worked -

and with stolen garments

on my wonderful shoulders,

when the sun just rises,

I break the door of my sweet-heart -



and in naked pride of my own,

when the sun is treading

on the working backs of the ugly,

I throw to my sweet-heart

the gleaming prey of the night -

and she smiles like the queen of queens -,

she is a grand thief too,

the magnificent vanity

which my sweet-heart is -



I am the proudest of thieves -

when the sun roars its day-song,

my hair will sparkle like stolen diamonds

over the world of bent backs -

when the sun is singing and the day is high,

my wonderful love is my own -


a little song



I have killed mary ann's god -

mary ann dreads my god -

I love mary ann -

when the burning blackness stands out before me,

I leave mary ann

to her love of me -







when the pale sun rises

with its blue morning-wet eyes,

I return to mary ann

with my love of her -

poor mary ann -

and poor me -

but we have a great heart

together -

mary ann and I -


to the earth



now, mother -,

I have covered my face into yourbosom-

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -

now, mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -



mother -,

you gave me the power of giving the comfort

which alone isnourishingand bright -

but, mother -,

I would only once give, what you have given me,

and not being forced to take back my gifts ashitherto

for the sake of your purity -, my mother -



but now,

mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -


the ring



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -







I dig the claws of my soul

deep into the rock -

downwards, downwards -



the rock of darkness

has devoured me -

all directions

but one are torn asunder -

downwards, downwards -!



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -

softly, softly

I sink through the mountains

of blindness -



soon

I shall eat the scent

of the hearts of my brothers -

soon my drop

can't be distinguished

from those of my brothers -

soon the river

will close the ring of future -


the dawn is grey over the sea



my race is as old

as the earth,

and my race is as rich -

but I

was born young,

my parents I couldn't find

and my kingdom neither -

my servants will not obey me,

and the women around me I scorn -







am I the last

cry of a drowning wave,

or am I the fresh-born foam

of the first approaching breakers

along an unknown shore -?



the patience of my pride

has no limits -

but the eye of my maledom

is blind -


to the body of my music



you speechless, useless

thing,

which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

what are you

really -?

are you just a trumpet,

you thing of my love -?

are you just atalon,

you beloved thing of my anger -?

or just an unused knife,

you beloved thing of my pride -?

what are you,

are you anything

real at all -?

come on,

you speechless, useless thing,

come on,

you which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

let us blow in your stupid trumpet,

let us tear with those insane talons,

let us use, then, this unused knife -,

come on, you -,

help me







to destroy

this human heart ofbarrenness

loiteringthrough all time

in this wonderful piece

of nature -,

come on now,

you -,

whatever you may be then

really -!


god of all nature



god of all nature,

if you would take

me in your unseen hand

to be filled or to fill -!

god of all nature,

and you will

or you will not, and

I am still yours,

a foot in the dark,

god of all nature -


leaving



don't believe

one more word

from any lips -

all words are poisoned -

only believe

what your eyes will love,

and your fingers want to touch -

there is a great sleep

still rising in all nature -

seek your rest there -

then

your eyes can't be deceived,

then







your eyes shall know their love

and their enemy without question,

and your fingers shall unlock

never-opened doors,

which must be opened -

and then

your soul will have no more goals

and no more words wherewith

to build evil walls,

wherewith to make unclean arms -

there is still the great sleep waiting -


and now we'll say



and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and now we'll say it:

we want

a new music into this world -



still we are no niggers -,

because we laugh in angry pain

over this insane civilization -

and still we are no infants

any longer -,

only because we are still able to laugh our corroding anger

over this hateful civilization -

and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and we'll say this too:

we can't be soothed any more

with caresses from this world

and we shall not -,

until we have

got a new music

into this world -







and don't believe

that we might just be let to die

in peaceful starvation,

before having crushed forth

the new music of ours

into this world -!


my people



- my scattered people

is a people of haters -

and I believe

in its ragged banners

of blackness -,

loitering

like withheld storms

over this play-world

of frightened pity -

the sign of hatred

is the sign of

the will to die alive,

and not

dance in garments of love

the life of death -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

but its lips

are denying,

and its eyes are contempt -

a people who see

is forced

to hate a world who's blind -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

and its way

is the way of all haters -






warning



why do you return

to me -?

now there are no fetters left

for you to seek

and grasp and rule me by -

why do you return -?

all returning is wrong -

now I am a thousand times

more dangerous -

now all the dikes

are broken -

and the ways of my flood

are unknown even to my own

notcaring eye -

and now

all generosity of my heart

has gone,

and my old fountain

of tenderness is dry -

so why do you return -?

there is nothing left

in me of that,

which you care for -

there is only

a dark, stained will

of destruction left,

which I cannot guide

and am not willed to

any more -

so what do you return

for now -?

even my sight of you

is dim by now -

but come,

come -

what do I care -






blindness



I have built a great tower,

sort of enormous light-house

to my inner eye -

each stone above another

is a pride,

each stone above another

is another pride -

and each pride

is stronger and more hard

than the other -

the colour of each stone

is red from love -

never-sated love, sharp

like rubies -

the eye on top of the tower,

blind from mad pride,

is hunger,

hunger,

hunger -

lifted like a bright axe,

threatening the sun

and the sky,

a dry, mad eye,

more proud than the sun at noon

over a pale sea -


evening in the forest



only man has made himself

his god,

only the god, man, can become

old and die -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know

some of which we see only one time

some of which are but names -

- I am not old and I am not young,







I know only

the gods of growth and birth and death,

they don't speak to us, they

don't want our prayers, and

sometimes I've heard them laugh

and sometimes weep -

what do they

care about man and his angry claims,

they know but growth and birth and death

why should we claim to be men -?

- sometimes I hear my laughter answered,

and sometimes my sorrow -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know -


song of the council



the name of our

wisdom is wine and dance

and silence -

the name of the great hunger

is the same -

the goddess of wisdom

is always alone,

and always drunk

and always she feels

the far-off rhythm of the unknown

teasing her pride, binding

her tongue, releasing

the voices of her listening blood -

we'll protect her aloneness

and shield her silence,

her words do creep strange ways -


nights



there are nights when I know much -

when no stars venture to ascend

the black walls of pride -







when all the great cans are broken

without a sound -

when no timid heart can catch the tune

from the gates of orgy -

nights with no prices,

nights void of fear -



there are nights when I know much -

when the unseen rivers are felt

creeping blackly beneath my feet,

carrying silently the directions of the world's caravans -

nights when no man,

and no cry does mean much -

there are nights when the rivers show new ways of life,

only for the proud to use -

nights

for bursting wombs

to blossom,

for dying hearts

to kill -,

silent nights -,

nights for great tribes

to change their path for ever -,

for weapons never heard-of

to be seized by sleeping fingers -,

nights without speech -



nights when strings, rarely touched,

will disturb fate's sleep -,

nights from which

some men shall awake with new eyes

and few words left in their heart -


what is there



what is there

but eternal giving away

of yourself,







and eternal being born

anew to yourself -?

what is there

but millions of strange gods

in the sea, in the sun,

in the air,

gods and gods and gods,

dangerous and sometimes mild -?

what is there

but thousands of loves

in wombs, in hearts,

in the earth,

love and love and love,

murderous and sometimes like bread -?

what is there

but eternally being too weak

and eternally being stronger

than yourself -?


the song of my tribe



the men of my tribe

are mostly silent

and most of days

they go wandering

towards some unknown calling -



the men of my tribe

are mostly serious

and most of days

they go thinking

how far off the rest of their hearts do linger -



the men of my tribe

are mostly hungry

but on certain days

they sate their bodies

and souls in short joy -







the men of my tribe

are on the way towards the deserts

and the staring caves where life has hiddert,

to make their fires there -

the men of my tribe are mostly silent -


song



I have no need of women,

why should I

why should you -?

I have no need of men,

why should I

why should you -?

- sometimes I want to love,

then I set off

far away, or not far,

for where love is -

why should I

why should you -?

it is fine to seek what you want,

fine to wander far or not far,

to seek what you want,

it is fine to be always proud -

why should I

why should you -?


the time has come



the time has come,

when man shall no more

try to be anything

but man besides the rest which

is not us -

the time has come,

when the ruler shall

be a ruler only among the rulers,

when the lover shall be a lover







only among lovers,

the time has come,

when man shall have to

be himself only,

and be that

to the rest which is not him -


where is laughter -?



when I sing songs

to the Unknown which made me burn,

there is laughter in my heart -

when I dance the rhythm

of life in honour of the gods of Blood,

there is laughter hissing

somewhere -

when I pour my joy into some open womb

to feel breed of the Earth in my buttocks,

there is big laughter sending roots

into soil -

o where, where is laughter -?



to fight death like the men of my tribe

is to behold

armies of flaring laughters

between the world and

you always -

o where, where is laughter -?

to hunt death in silent anger

by day and by night

as the price of sleep,

is life -

o where, where is laughter -?


there's still riches



what do we care about anything

but the real thing -!

what are the systems of mankind to us -?







wewant the pearl that's cheap like grey stone,

the gust of wind, precious like our mother's heart -

o, no -!

there's still some cruel laughter bidden in our blood,

still rich.es clinging to our bare hands -

oh no - oh no -!

still we're too cautious

to put in our lot with mankind's -

o, no -!

the tribes don't speak each others' tongues,

why should they -!

oh -, our pride is still a good tent

'gainst mankind's dry winds -

isn't our laughter too sharp -?

oh yes - yes - it is -!

what dowecare about anything

but the real thing -?

what is the sick clamour of mankind to us -?

ifourdeath will visit us,

we'll receive her duly -

but mankind's -?

oh no, she has too easy wings -

o, no to us there's still riches waiting

on our bare, wet rocks -


the weapon



hunger has left me -

love has left me -

longing for events is not with me -

misfortune has found me out -



but joy cannot slay -,

and the love, you find, cannot slay -,

if I held a weapon, that

could hit by itself -!

but hunger has left me -

and love has left me -







no longing is with me now -

it must come by itself -

or stay away -

the green, the warm,

the weapon,

which need not hit -


hidden striving



there is silence in my world -

therefore I sing low songs through the nights -

the silence creeps mistlike,

eating my world -

the small things I know

will not answer

the great things I need -

the low songs of my faith

cannot stop

the bleeding of hunger's blood -

but the nights are innumerable -,

I'll work 'pon my tunes,

till they shine flickering,

hazy like old weapons -,

till they stand like pale noble cans

dripping with dangerous wine -

I shall sate silence,

night by night,

with exquisitely carved instruments, and pearls

beyond value -

- low songs creep mistlike,

seeking the faith of silence -


spring journey



- by night I left the world's house,

wandered deep into

myself,

leaving each door unclosed -







no stars were there, no sun, no moon,

I fought through barren wildernesses

with blindness lurking

on each step, with corroding poison

eating the sight of soul and body -

I went still deeper -,

I groped through rocky darkness

into utter void -

my eyes had died,

all sound had fled,

the soul shrank in dread, the last,

from nothingness -

- I staggered

deeper -

and from beyond despair

read with blinded eyes

the tale of man's spring -

carved in stone -

fuller and truer -

redeeming everything -

like a flower -


finished



no more havanas

no more dancing

and

no more happiness - no

happiness -

no more gold -

no gold, but

merciless

value - new

value -



no more madness -

no more barrenness -

and no more mercy -

- bread, children and







a new value to get light from

with no margin -

and no mercy -

a new scale

without mercy and

without escape -

not one -!

not THAT

any more

not once

more -

again -



now -

at last -

no more substitutes -

and no patience -

and no patience -

at last -

and no substitutes -

and

no

patience

any more -

it has grown

too late -

and there is

no holiday

left -



what is left for

you, you and you -

and you

is

thelast

the ultimate last

left opportunity

foreverything-







the new price,

or nothing -

the new

life or sterile death -

this minute and not tomorrow -

and no mercy -

and no kissing -

and

no escape -!
