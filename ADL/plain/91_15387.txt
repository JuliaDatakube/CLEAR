such is my love



rocky souls on the way, where

supreme delight

is but beautifying sleep -,

such is my love



that if you are stricken with mortal pain

because of me,

it is a thousand times better than

had you never met me -



if with unclean hands

I steal your sacred crown,

you shall be a thousand times more pure,

when I have left -



and if for my joy

you are killed in the meanest way,

by my hand your lips shall reach,

awakening, the brow of The Most High -



listen, every lonesome rocky soul:

not one minute anyone of you are left -!

such is my love for each of you -
