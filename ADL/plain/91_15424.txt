wind



my love is the merciless killer -

my love is sailing in blood -

my love can only subdue -

my love can't like the subdued -

my love doesn't want no more blood -



on the rock

the far-off eyes of the albatross

is waiting -

the reef

is not the last -

the goal is one only -

that is

what the wind must bring -

soon -

the wind only

is eternal -
