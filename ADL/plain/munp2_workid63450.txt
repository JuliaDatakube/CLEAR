hidden strivingthere is silence in my world -therefore I sing low songs through the nights -the silence creeps mistlike,eating my world -the small things I knowwill not answerthe great things I need -the low songs of my faithcannot stopthe bleeding of hunger's blood -but the nights are innumerable -,I'll work 'pon my tunes,till they shine flickering,hazy like old weapons -,till they stand like pale noble cansdripping with dangerous wine -I shall sate silence,night by night,with exquisitely carved instruments, and pearlsbeyond value -- low songs creep mistlike, seeking the faith of silence -
