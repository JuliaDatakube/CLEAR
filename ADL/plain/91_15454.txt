my evening has come



here I sit -

looking into my flickering fire

before me -

outside the tent

my enemies are whispering

to each other -

I was the victor always -

I could never be conquered -

they could not touch me -



here I sit -

the all-embracing serenity

on me -

always my deepest desire

was fulfilled -

my success is still as clean, as new ice -

I was always able to take

my soul's want -

I was able

to make of my self what I wanted -,

what I must -






I could never be conquered -

I was always the victor -

here I sit -

with my legs crossed, looking

with far-off eyes into my own fire -

outside the tent

the hatred goes on whispering -

to night I shall be murdered -

I -, the victor -,

I who couldn't be conquered -

my unpierceable quietude embraces everything

like the first mother -

here I sit -

with my tent around me -

my evening has come -
