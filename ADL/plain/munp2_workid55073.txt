the god of the blood
	(1  song)I have given over the gods of 1935 - I have given over the god of pleasure with the gildedforgyldt hands and the green face -- I have goneto the god of the blood -I have given overthe god of comfortwith the murmuring anxietyand the rotten love-hands -- I have goneto the god of the blood - I have known the god of the bread, the blind warrior -he gave the breadand the hunger for bread,he said: "I know you not" -- I have goneto the god of the blood -I have foughtthe god of happiness,the soft-shouldered -he gave what he had,but he died on my sword -he whispered: "I hate you" -- I have goneto the god of the blood -!he gave me nothing -,he said: "I have butthe cruelty which is truth -,I have but the aloneness,which is the way -,I have but the place,where to waitwith ice on your life -,my hand is no giver -,my hand is the unbroken law -.I am the god of the blood" -- I have gone -,and my lips are locked -l have gone -,I have touched the flame,which leaves no ashesand no love to man nor woman -
