hymnthe house of my certaintyis so vastthat I never can touch its walls -the room of my deepest desireis so sacredthat none but my friend and my womancan be permitted to enter -the tower of my watchman's eyeis so highthat the fall of my deathnever can reachthe aim of my fear -the sword of my prideis so hardthat never the corroding impurityassembled from all the worldcan stain its brightness -to every upright soul in distressthe house of my certaintyis open -to every fighting will of bloodmy gleaming eyeis the unfailing sign of victory,of inexhaustible rest -to every succumbing puritythe garden of my healing loveis preparedwith unvanquished tenderness -the house of my certaintyis nobody's property -Iam the ever-watching openerof its silent gate -
