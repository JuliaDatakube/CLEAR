the castle



the eyes of my longing have grown impatient -

my longing claims irresistably

its fulfilling -

and me, the waiting dreamer,

she has forced to work -



my longing has declared everyone her enemy -

the burning swords of the sun

have become her slaves -

the silent cows of the moon

have become her slaves too -

irresistable my longing

has declared everything her enemy -

and of me, the patient lover of glory,

she has made a slave -



between the two rivers,

all around

the free country of my glory

is being raised a towering castle,

and no light nor sound

is to be let in -

I, the idling waster of happiness,

have been made a slave -

towards heaven

the castle is rising -,

in the dirt is bent the face of my glory -

towards heaven the walls are rising -

impregnable the walls

of my prison are rising -

in the tower am I -

no light nor sound

from my glory is let in -



my longing has grown impatient,

my longing claims its fulfilling -

in the tower she is coming to see me -

- she claims, what is hers -
