the god of the blood(1 song)



I have given over

the gods of 1935 -

I have given over

the god of pleasure

with thegildedhands

and the green face -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have given over

the god of comfort

with the murmuring anxiety

and the rotten love-hands -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have known

the god of the bread,

the blind warrior -






he gave the bread

and the hunger for bread,

he said: "I know you not" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have fought

the god of happiness,

the soft-shouldered -

he gave what he had,

but he died on my sword -

he whispered: "I hate you" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -!

he gave me nothing -,

he said: "I have but

the cruelty which is truth -,

I have but the aloneness,

which is the way -,

I have but the place,

where to wait

with ice on your life -,

myhand is no giver -,

myhand is the unbroken law -.

I am the god of the blood" -

- I have gone -,

and my lips are locked -

l have gone -,

I have touched the flame,

which leaves no ashes

and no love to man nor woman -
