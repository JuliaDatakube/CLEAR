spring journey



- by night I left the world's house,

wandered deep into

myself,

leaving each door unclosed -






no stars were there, no sun, no moon,

I fought through barren wildernesses

with blindness lurking

on each step, with corroding poison

eating the sight of soul and body -

I went still deeper -,

I groped through rocky darkness

into utter void -

my eyes had died,

all sound had fled,

the soul shrank in dread, the last,

from nothingness -

- I staggered

deeper -

and from beyond despair

read with blinded eyes

the tale of man's spring -

carved in stone -

fuller and truer -

redeeming everything -

like a flower -
