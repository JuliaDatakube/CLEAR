where is laughter -?when I sing songsto the Unknown which made me burn,there is laughter in my heart -when I dance the rhythmof life in honour of the gods of Blood,there is laughter hissingsomewhere -when I pour my joy into some open wombto feel breed of the Earth in my buttocks,there is big laughter sending rootsinto soil -o where, where is laughter -?to fight death like the men of my tribeis to beholdarmies of flaring laughtersbetween the world andyou always -o where, where is laughter -?to hunt death in silent angerby day and by nightas the price of sleep,is life -o where, where is laughter -?
