blindnessI have built a great tower,sort of enormous light-houseto my inner eye -each stone above anotheris a pride,each stone above anotheris another pride -and each prideis stronger and more hardthan the other -the colour of each stoneis red from love -never-sated love, sharplike rubies -the eye on top of the tower,blind from mad pride,is hunger,hunger,hunger -lifted like a bright axe,threatening the sunand the sky,a dry, mad eye,more proud than the sun at noonover a pale sea -
