nightsthere are nights when I know much - when no stars venture to ascend the black walls of pride -when all the great cans are brokenwithout a sound -when no timid heart can catch the tunefrom the gates of orgy -nights with no prices,nights void of fear -there are nights when I know much -when the unseen rivers are feltcreeping blackly beneath my feet,carrying silently the directions of the world's caravans -nights when no man,and no cry does mean much -there are nights when the rivers show new ways of life,only for the proud to use -nightsfor bursting wombsto blossom,for dying heartsto kill -,silent nights -,nights for great tribesto change their path for ever -,for weapons never heard-ofto be seized by sleeping fingers -,nights without speech -nights when strings, rarely touched,will disturb fate's sleep -,nights from whichsome men shall awake with new eyesand few words left in their heart -
