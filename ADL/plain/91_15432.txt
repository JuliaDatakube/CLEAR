good-bye




you are my friend -, but

don't let yourself be fooled

by the fair skin on my face,

don't believe

in the sky-blue ring round my pupils -



my friend -, yes -,

but you shouldn't

trust me that

open way of yours with the sad, kind smile -,

one day -, my friend,

you shall not know me,

one day you shall not know

me,

the born hater of what you love -



my friend -, with the outstretched hands,

my friend,







do turn your eye away

frommyhand,

always waiting, always awake -

my friend,

you know me not,

you have never seen me,

don't call me your friend,

I amnone,

can't be,

I hate you,

I must -,

turn away your eye -!

from me -



my friend -,

go -!

be aware -:

mysoul is not light

as yours -,

myblood is not

like the petals of roses -,

like yours -

the gloomy red of the sudden night,

that'smysoul -

the darting black on the puma's flank

does crouch inmyveins,

the inflexible jet on the stone of death,

that'smyblood -



my friend be aware -!

you must -

you are my enemy,

I can never know you -

my eyes despise

yourwomen -

my brow despises

yourclamorous love -,

youlaugh







atmysharpened silence -

- your garden, young man,

is filled with flowers,

the songs from your lips

are cunning, and the buds

will open -,

but your sight shall for ever

be hazy from love -, and never you shall know,

from what soil your songs did rise -



young man,

I must leave you,

for ever your people should mistrust me,

for ever, at your side,

I should be a stranger in every country -,

never

amongst your people I would find my righteous mate -




young man,

I must leave you -

mygathering race

shall never be strong

at peace withyours-

- the world was conquered by the pale-blooded -,

for centuries my race has been slaving -

but the slaves begot kings,

and the kings did slave, and their children,

for centuries -

the pale people forgot the law of their own gods -

they have lost the secret,

that gave the world to their sway -

the people of the pale has lost their hands -



but the god of my race has returned

from the bath of death -

- good-bye -!

I hear the call -







- the god of silence

with the will of the sun on his brow

has sent the spear of war

to me

his man -
