to my woman



don't speak to me yet -,

I can't listen -

don't look at me yet -,

I can't meet you -

you who have the right

don't touch me -

yet my skin is not bright -



I

have no right yet -,

I

am not allowed yet

to take my right -

I have liked

thepale-browedwomen of the enemy -

don't claim no tenderness

from me -

I gave it to them,

that was all they could take -

don't claim no strenght

from me -

that was what they wanted -






don't mention to me

my name -

don't mention to me

myrighteouspower -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -

the will of my blood

has returned to the lake of our dead,

to wash from its heart the pale-blooded hatred -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -
