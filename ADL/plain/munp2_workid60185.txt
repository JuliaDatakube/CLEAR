the gull- this rockis my place -my eyesare setting off on low wingsfrom this rock -- this seais my life -my eyesare hovering on motionless wingsover this sea -- my eyescan grip only the far-off -my eyes know no short distances -- my eyeshave no colour to change -my eyes are indifference to everything -my eyes remember nothing but their unseen aim -- my eyesdon't wait for anybody to rise -my eyes know their place and their life -:this rock -this sea -- everything else is dead unto my eyes -
