the time has come



the time has come,

when man shall no more

try to be anything

but man besides the rest which

is not us -

the time has come,

when the ruler shall

be a ruler only among the rulers,

when the lover shall be a lover






only among lovers,

the time has come,

when man shall have to

be himself only,

and be that

to the rest which is not him -
